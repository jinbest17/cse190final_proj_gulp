<h2>History</h2>
        <p>Founded in 1960, UC San Diego enrolled its first undergraduates in 1964. Nevertheless, the campus can trace its origins as far back as the late 1800s. At that time, zoologists at the UC Berkeley campus, seeking a suitable location for a marine field station, found the La Jolla area of San Diego a very desirable site. The facility they established became a part of the University of California in 1912 and was eventually named the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. In the late 1950s, when the regents of the University of California decided to situate a general campus in the region, Scripps Institution of Oceanography  formed the nucleus of the new campus. </p>
<h2>The Colleges of UC San Diego</h2>
        <p>Undergraduates at UC San Diego enjoy the benefits of a great university combined with the advantages of a small liberal arts college. The master plan conceived by the university&rsquo;s founders borrowed from Oxford and Cambridge Universities&rsquo; concept to provide a family of colleges, each with its own special academic and social flavor. UC San Diego&rsquo;s students gain a sense of belonging through affiliation with one of the campus&rsquo;s semiautonomous colleges.</p>
<p>There are six colleges: <a href="Revelle-front.html">Revelle</a>, <a href="Muir-front.html">John Muir</a>, <a href="TMC-front.html">Thurgood Marshall</a>, <a href="Warren-front.html">Earl Warren</a>, <a href="ERC-front.html">Eleanor Roosevelt</a>, and <a href="sixth-front.html">Sixth</a> College. Each is independent and yet interrelated to the others: All university academic and support facilities are available to every student, regardless of his or her college affiliation. Each college has its own educational philosophies and traditions, its own set of general-education requirements, and its own administrative and advising staff.  </p>
