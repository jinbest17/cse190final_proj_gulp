				<p class="course-descriptions">Game theory in economics is a very serious business. A game is defined by a complete set of rules that govern who plays the game, the decisions they confront, their state of knowledge at decision points, and the outcomes resulting from their decisions. It is a sometimes-maddening field in which intuitively obvious strategies can be inferior, credible threats have no credibility, and flipping a coin might be the best decision. This course offers a careful study of game theory basics with the intention of leading to a coherent set of insights into real-world strategic concerns.

Some might possess value relevant private information about a security, or think they do. Some professional traders serve as counterparties for these other trader types. One of the central themes in this course is that institutions and experience matter, even when no trader possesses value relevant prior information.
