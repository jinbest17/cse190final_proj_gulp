  San Diego General Catalog 2019&#8211;20<em>, please contact the department
  for more information.</em></p><!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p>All undergraduate students enrolled in structural engineering courses or admitted into the structural engineering program are expected to meet prerequisite and performance standards. Additional details are given under the various program outlines, course descriptions, and admission procedures for the School of Engineering in this catalog. The department expects that students will adhere to these policies on their own volition and enroll in courses accordingly. Students are advised that they may be dropped at any time from course rosters if prerequisites and/or performance standards have not been met. </p>
<p>While some courses may be offered more than once each year, most SE courses are taught only once per year, and courses are scheduled to be consistent with the curricula as shown in the tables. When possible, SE does offer selected large-enrollment courses more than once each year. A tentative schedule of course offerings is available from the department each spring for the following academic year. </p>
