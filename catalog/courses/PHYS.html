The dynamics of single cells is considered at different levels of abstraction, e.g., biophysical and &ldquo;reduced&rdquo; models for analysis of regularly spiking and bursting cells, their dynamical properties, and their representation in phase space. Laboratory exercises will accompany the lectures. Duplicate credit not allowed for cross-listed courses: BGGN 260, BENG 260,  PHYS 279. </p>
