        <p>The Chinese language program offers Mandarin Chinese language acquisition
          courses in yearlong sequences that begin in the fall quarter. Students
          interested in enrolling in Chinese courses must be evaluated via a
          Placement Interview and authorized at the Chinese Studies Program prior
          to enrollment. Contact the program at <a href="mailto:chinesestudies@ucsd.edu">chinesestudies@ucsd.edu</a> for
          more information. </p>
        <p>Chinese language courses are divided into three tracks based on student’s
          familiarity with the language. N track is for students with no Chinese
          language background; M track is for students with some Mandarin Chinese
          language background; and D track is for students with Chinese language
          background other than Mandarin. By the third year of Chinese language
          acquisition courses the M and D tracks converge. </p>
