<h4>Financial Support</h4>
<p>Financial support is determined by the admissions committee for the first year. In subsequent years, all graduate students receive funding contingent on normal progress in the program. The typical package includes a teaching assistantship, fee remission, and tuition scholarship (for nonresidents).</p>
<h4>Typical Program</h4>
<p>A math review course (ECON 205) is offered prior to fall quarter. This is an intensive review of analysis, single and multi-variable calculus, and optimization<strong>, </strong>and is designed to prepare entering students for their first year of study. Entering students with confidence in their mathematical skills are not required to take the course. However, all students are required to pass the final exam in the class.</p>
<p>Throughout the duration of the program each student is required to maintain full-time enrollment status, at least twelve units, to be eligible for any form of <a href="http://economics.ucsd.edu/graduate-program/financial-support/index.html">financial support</a>. Excellent supplements to the schedule of core and elective courses to ensure full-time enrollment status are ECON 202A-B-C, ECON 212A-B-C, ECON 235A-B-C, ECON 291, ECON 297, ECON 299, and ECON 500A-B-C.</p>
<p>All core and elective courses taken to fulfill program requirements must be taken for a letter grade (unless otherwise specified below). Economics course titles and descriptions are <a href="http://www.ucsd.edu/catalog/courses/ECON.html" target="_blank">online</a>.</p>

<h4>Elective Requirements</h4><p class="anchor-parent"><a class="anchor" id="General"></a></p>
<p><strong>General requirements for all doctoral students: </strong></p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Seven elective courses are required in order      to advance to candidacy.</li>
  <li><strong>All seven courses must be taken for a      letter grade (A, B, C, etc.).</strong></li>
  <li>Cumulative GPA of 3.5 or better must be earned      in these seven courses.</li>
  <li>Students must elect two fields of economics      for advanced study.</li>
  <li>Each field requires completion of two to three      graduate courses.</li>
  <li>Students are to complete all seven of these      courses by the end of their third year.</li>
  <li>Students should strive to complete their field      requirements in the second year.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students may enroll in independent study or relevant courses from other departments. However, in general, these courses cannot be counted among the seven electives.</p>
<h4>Qualifying Examinations</h4>
<p>Written qualifying exams in each of the three core fields (microeconomics, macroeconomics, and econometrics) are required and are offered each year at the end of spring quarter and again at the end of summer session. Each exam is administered and graded separately. To continue in the doctoral program, all three exams must be passed by the end of spring quarter of the student’s second year in the program. No exceptions will be made to this policy.</p>
<p>In preparation for the qualifying exams, the department expects a student to be competent relative to existing knowledge on the subject. The specific guide to subject matter needed for competence in a field is the body of topics covered in the first-year courses in that field. More information on qualifying exams can be found on the department&rsquo;s website at <a href="http://economics.ucsd.edu" target="_blank">http://economics.ucsd.edu</a>. </p>
<h4>Advancement to Candidacy (CPHIL Degree)</h4>
<p>To attain candidacy, the student must complete an oral examination covering the topic of the proposed thesis before the members of their doctoral committee. The prerequisites for applying for the candidacy exam are</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Pass the qualifying examinations      (microeconomics, macroeconomics, and econometrics)</li>
  <li>Complete a computation course (ECON 280)</li>
  <li>Complete advanced econometrics courses (ECON      220D–F)</li>
  <li>Complete an empirical project (as part of ECON      220F)</li>
  <li>Complete the <a href="http://economics.ucsd.edu/graduate-program/phd-in-economics/elective-requirements.html" target="_blank">elective requirements</a></li>
  <li>Complete a third-year original paper and      presentation (ECON 285/296)</li>
  <li>Complete the graduate research presentation      workshop (ECON 286)</li>
</ul>
<p>It is expected that students will advance to candidacy before the start of the fourth year.</p>
<p>Papers should be submitted to the committee for review at least four weeks before the CPHIL examination date. Students must notify the department graduate coordinator of their doctoral committee members at least one month before the CPHIL date.</p>
<h4>Dissertation</h4>
<p>By the end of the second year, a student has passed the qualifying examinations, has selected a dissertation topic, and conducts background study on the topic. The normal mechanisms for topic development are</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Elective courses</li>
  <li>Participation in workshops and colloquia</li>
  <li>Consultation with the dissertation committee</li>
</ul>
<p>After completing a dissertation acceptable to the committee, a student will present a final oral examination on the dissertation. The presentation is open to the public; family, friends, and classmates may be invited to attend.</p>
<h3>Master of Arts in Economics</h3>
<p>The Department of Economics does not offer a master’s program. Students in the doctoral program may apply for the MA upon completion of the degree requirements below, usually following the first year of study in the doctoral program.</p>
<h4>History of the Degree</h4>
<p>The MA degree meets the needs of three types of students:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Students who, though capable of satisfactory      academic performance, decide not to continue their studies toward the PhD.</li>
  <li>Students advised by the department not to      continue in the doctoral program but who have mastered certain basic      segments.</li>
  <li>Students who will continue in the program but      need an MA degree for summer or part-time jobs.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The MA is not a degree that students in the doctoral program routinely obtain in the course of their doctoral work; it is strictly incidental to the program. The university will not award an MA in economics if one has been awarded by another department or institution in similar fields.</em></p>
<h4>Requirements</h4>
<p>To qualify for the master&rsquo;s degree, a student must have been admitted to the doctoral program. The requirements for the degree are</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>Complete, with at least a B average,      thirty-six units in upper-division undergraduate or doctoral level      economics courses, of which at least twenty-four units must come from the      core first-year doctoral sequence (ECON 200, 210, 220).</li>
  <li>Complete one of the following:</li>
  <ol start="1" type="1">
    <li>Receive at least a master’s pass in two core       doctoral qualifying exams.</li>
    <li>Receive at least a master’s pass in one of       the core doctoral qualifying exams, and a B+ average in the first-year       courses in a second core field.</li>
    <li>Receive at least a master’s pass or receive       a B+ average in one core field and write an independent paper approved by       three economics faculty members (one outside faculty member allowed) as a       master&rsquo;s thesis.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<p><em>A minimum of one quarter must elapse between application for candidacy for the MA degree and the filing of the final report for the award of the degree. Forms turned in by the end of the second week of the quarter may be conferred at the end of that quarter.</em></p>
<h4>Department FAQs: </h4>
<p><em><a href="http://economics.ucsd.edu/graduate-program/faqs.html" target="_blank">http://economics.ucsd.edu/graduate-program/faqs.html</a></em></p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Departmental PhD Time Limit Policies </h3>
				<p>Students must be advanced to candidacy by the end of five years. Total
				  university support cannot exceed six years. Total registered
				  time at UC San Diego cannot exceed seven years. Students will
				  not be permitted to continue beyond the precandidacy and total
				  registered time limits. Students will not be permitted to receive
				  UC San Diego administered financial support beyond the support limit. </p>
				<h3>PhD in Economics with a Specialization in Interdisciplinary Environmental Research </h3>
				<p>A graduate specialization in Interdisciplinary Environmental Research (PIER) is available for select doctoral students in economics. PIER students seek solutions to today’s environmental challenges. <strong> </strong></p>
		<p>The PhD specialization is designed to allow students to obtain standard training in their chosen field and an opportunity to interact with peers in different disciplines throughout the duration of their doctoral projects. Such communication across disciplines is key to fostering a capacity for interdisciplinary &ldquo;language&rdquo; skills and conceptual flexibility.</p>
				<h4>Specialization Requirements<br>
        </h4>
        <ul type="disc">
                  <li>Complete      all course work, dissertation, and other requirements of<strong> </strong>the economics PhD<strong> </strong></li>
                  <li>16-unit      interdisciplinary boot camp (summer SIO 295S–295LS)</li>
                  <li>8      units from a secondary field (outside the home department) </li>
                  <li>6      units (3 quarters) Interdisciplinary Environmental Research Forum (SIO 296)</li>
                  <li>At      least one chapter of the dissertation will be broadly related to      environmental research and will be interdisciplinary in nature. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Application Requirements</h4>
                  </em></strong>
                  <p>We advise students to begin PIER in their third year upon completion of core economics<strong> </strong>course requirements. The following items should be combined into a single PDF document and submitted to <a href="mailto:cmbc@ucsd.edu" target="_blank">cmbc@ucsd.edu</a>.
        </p>
                  </p>

                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>Student’s      CV</li>
                  <li>Half-page      abstract of proposed thesis work </li>
                  <li>Up to one-page      statement of student’s interest in interdisciplinary environmental      research including career goals. </li>
