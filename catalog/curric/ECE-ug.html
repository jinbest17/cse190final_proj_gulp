        <p class="anchor-parent"><a class="anchor" id="ugrad"></a></p><h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">The Undergraduate Programs </h2>
				<p>The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering offers undergraduate programs leading to the BS in <strong class="myriad-pro-semibold">electrical engineering, engineering physics,</strong> and computer engineering, and the BA in <strong class="myriad-pro-semibold">electrical engineering and society. </strong>Each of these programs can be tailored to provide preparation for graduate study or employment in a wide range of fields. The Electrical Engineering (BS) program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, <a href="http://www.abet.org" target="_blank">http://www.abet.org</a>. </p>
				<p>Students in the Electrical Engineering Program must take lower-division courses in electrical engineering, mathematics, chemistry, and physics (sixty-eight units or seventy-two units, depending on selected depth) and follow a very flexible structure in the upper-division depth requirements (sixty-four units or sixty-eight units, depending on selected depth, for a total of 140 units of lower-division and upper-division course work in any given depth). After the lower-division courses, all students must take upper-division courses that include a combination of breadth courses, depth courses, technical electives, two professional electives, and one design course.&nbsp; </p>
		<p>The Engineering Physics Program is conducted in cooperation with the Department of Physics. Its structure is very similar to that of electrical engineering except the depth requirement includes seven courses and there are only five electives. </p>
				<p>The Computer Engineering Program is conducted jointly with the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. It has a more prescribed structure. The program encompasses the study of hardware design, data storage, computer architecture, assembly languages, and the design of computers for engineering, information retrieval, and scientific research. </p>
				<p>The BA—Electrical Engineering and Society Program intends to better prepare engineering students in the areas of social sciences and the humanities, as a response to the globalization of engineering and technology. We recognize that “engineering only” training may not be sufficient when students seek alternate career paths besides engineering upon graduation, such as in the law, finance, and public policy sectors.</p>
				<p>For information about the program and about academic advising, students are referred to the section on ECE departmental regulations. In order to complete the programs in a timely fashion, students must plan their courses carefully, starting in their freshman year. Students should have sufficient background in high school mathematics so that they can take freshman calculus in the first quarter. </p>
				<p>For graduation, each student must also satisfy general-education requirements determined by the student&#8217;s college. The six colleges at UC San Diego require widely different numbers of general-education courses. Students should choose their college carefully, considering the special nature of the college and the breadth of education required. They should realize that some colleges require considerably more courses than others. Students wishing to transfer to another college should see their college adviser. </p>
				<p>Graduates of community colleges may enter ECE programs in the junior year. However, transfer students should be particularly mindful of the freshman and sophomore course requirements when planning their programs. </p>
				<p>These programs have strong components in laboratory experiments and in the use of computers throughout the curricula. In addition, the department is committed to exposing students to the nature of engineering design. This is accomplished throughout the curricula by use of design-oriented homework problems, by exposure to engineering problems in lectures, by courses that emphasize student-initiated projects in both laboratory and computer courses, and finally by senior design-project courses in which teams of students work to solve an engineering design problem, often brought in from industry. </p>
				<p><strong class="myriad-pro-semibold">IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT STUDENTS DISCUSS THEIR CURRICULUM WITH THE APPROPRIATE DEPARTMENTAL ADVISER IMMEDIATELY UPON ENTRANCE TO UC SAN DIEGO, AND THEN AT LEAST ONCE A YEAR UNTIL GRADUATION. </strong></p>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">BS Electrical Engineering Program </h3>
				<p>Students must complete 180 units for graduation, including the general-education requirements (GER). Note that 140 units (excluding GER) are required for the major. </p>

				<p>Technical electives must be upper-division engineering, math or physics courses (except for the bioengineering track). At most one lower-division course in engineering may be used but it must receive prior approval from the ECE department. Certain courses listed below are not allowed as electives because of overlap with ECE courses. </p>
				<p class="program-overview-subhead-6">Physics </p>
				<p>All upper-division physics courses. Students may not receive upper-division elective credit for any lower-division physics courses. </p>
				<p class="program-overview-subhead-6">Mathematics</p>
				<p>MATH 180A overlaps ECE 109 and therefore will not qualify for elective credit of either type. MATH 183 or MATH 186 will not be allowed as an elective. MATH 163 will only be allowed as a professional elective. All lower-division mathematics is excluded from elective credit of either type. </p>
				<p class="program-overview-subhead-6">Bioengineering</p>
				<p>The following series of courses will provide “core” preparation in bioengineering and will satisfy up to five courses of the ECE elective requirements: </p>
				<p>BILD 1, BILD 2, BE 100, BE 140A-B</p>
				<p>The bioengineering department will guarantee admission to these courses for ECE students on a space available basis. </p>
				<p class="program-overview-subhead-6">CSE</p>
				<p>The following courses are excluded as electives: CSE 3, 4GS, 6GS, 5A, 7, 8A-B, 11, 123A (duplicates ECE 158A), 140 (duplicates ECE 25), 140L (duplicates ECE 35). CSE 12, 20, and 21 will count toward the three professional electives ONLY. </p>
				<p class="program-overview-subhead-6">ECE</p>
        <p>Upper-division ECE courses that are not used to satisfy any other requirements.</p>
<p class="program-overview-subhead-6">Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering
				  (MAE)</p>
				<p>Credit will not be allowed for MAE 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 20, 105, 108, 139, 140, 143B, or 170. </p>
<p class="program-overview-subhead-6">Special Studies </p>
				<p>Courses 195–199: At most four units of 195–199 may be used for elective credit. </p>
				<h5 class="program-overview-subhead-4">2. Professional Electives </h5>
				<p>Professional electives are acceptable courses taken in one department. Normally these will be upper-division courses in engineering, mathematics, or physics. Students may also choose upper-division courses from other departments provided that they fit into a coherent professional program.

		<h3>Continuing Students Eligibility</h3>
				<p>The ECE department may grant admission to continuing undergraduate students who were not admitted to the department as entering students. Admission will be considered for students who have completed the screening courses below demonstrating special aptitude for the ECE curriculum. </p>
				<h6>Electrical engineering, engineering physics, electrical engineering and society majors: </h6>
                <ul>
                  <li>MATH 20A, 20B, 20C</li>
                  <li>PHYS 2A-B</li>
                  <li>ECE 35, 45, 65</li>
        </ul>
                <h6>Computer Engineering: </h6>
        <ul>
          <li>MATH 20A, 20B, 20C</li>

                  <li>CSE 8A/B or CSE 11 </li>
        </ul>
                <p>Students may apply in any quarter after they have completed the screening courses. They will be ranked according to grades received from the screening courses taken at UC San Diego. AP credit satisfies the requirement of the screening course but does not get factored into the GPA. All courses will be weighted equally. Applicants will be chosen from this ranking until all open slots in the major are filled. For information on how to change to an ECE major, go to <a href="http://ece.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/capped-major-status" target="_blank">http://ece.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/capped-major-status</a>. </p>
		<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Grade Requirement in the Major </h3>
				<p>Courses required for the major must be taken for a letter grade. All major courses must be completed with a grade of C– or better. </p>
				<p>A GPA of 2.0 is required in all upper-division courses in the major, including technical electives. The grade of D will not be considered an adequate prerequisite for any ECE course and will not be allowed for graduation. The engineering design requirement must be completed with a grade of C– or better. </p>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Advising </h3>
				<p>Students are recommended to complete an academic planning form and to discuss their curriculum with the appropriate departmental adviser immediately upon entrance to UC San Diego, and then every year until graduation. This is intended to help students in: a) their choice of depth sequence, b) their choice of electives, c) keeping up with changes in departmental requirements. </p>
				<h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">New Transfer Students in Electrical Engineering and Engineering Physics </h2>
				<p>The entire curriculum is predicated on the idea of actively involving students in engineering from the time they enter as freshmen. The freshman courses have been carefully crafted to provide an overview of the engineering mindset with its interrelationships among physics, mathematics, problem solving, and computation. All later courses are specifically designed to build on this foundation. All transfer students should understand that the lower-division curriculum is demanding. Transfer students will be required to take all lower-division requirements or their equivalent. Transfer students are advised to consult the ECE website for sample recommended course schedules and for the ECE course requirement guide. </p>
				<h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">New Transfer Students in Computer Engineering </h2>
				<p>Transfer students are advised to consult the ECE website for sample recommended course schedules and for the ECE course requirement guide. </p>
				<p>Students who do not have any programming experience are encouraged to take the CSE 8A-B sequence instead of CSE 11. Experience has shown that most students who are not familiar with programming and take CSE 11 have to retake the class because the accelerated pace makes it difficult to learn the new material. </p>
				<p><em>Note: </em>Transfer students are encouraged
				  to consult with the ECE undergraduate office for academic planning
				  upon entrance to UC San Diego.</p>
				<h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">ECE Honors Program </h2>
				<p>The ECE Undergraduate Honors Program is intended to give eligible students the opportunity to work closely with faculty in a project, and to honor the top graduating undergraduate students. </p>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Eligibility for Admission to the Honors
				  Program</h3>
				<ol>
				  <li>Students with a minimum GPA of 3.5 in the major and 3.25 overall
				    will be eligible to apply. Students may apply at the end
				    of the winter quarter of their junior year and no later than
				    the end of the second week of fall quarter of their senior year. No late
				    applications will be accepted. </li>
				  <li>Students must submit a project proposal (sponsored by an ECE faculty
				    member) to the honors program committee at the time of application. </li>
				  <li>The major GPA will include ALL lower division required for the major
				    and all upper division required for the major that are completed
				    at the time of application (a minimum of twenty-four units
				    of upper-division course work). </li>
	    </ol>
		<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Requirements for Award of Honors </h3>
				<ol>
				  <li>Completion of all ECE requirements with a minimum GPA of 3.5 in
				    the major based on grades through winter quarter of the senior
				    year. </li>
				  <li>Formal participation (i.e., registration and attendance) in the
				    ECE 290 graduate seminar program in the winter quarter of
				    their senior year. </li>
				  <li>Completion of an eight-unit approved honors project (ECE 193H: Honors
				    Project) and submission of a written report by the first
				    day of spring quarter of the senior year. This project must
				    contain enough design to satisfy the ECE BS four-unit design requirement. </li>
				  <li>The ECE honors committee will review each project final report and
				    certify the projects that have been successfully completed
				    at the honors level. </li>
	    </ol>
		<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Procedure for Application to the Honors
		  Program </h3>
				<p>Between the end of the winter quarter of their junior year and the second week of the fall quarter of their senior year, interested students must advise the department of their intention to participate by submitting a proposal for the honors project sponsored by an ECE faculty member. Admission to the honors program will be formally approved by the ECE honors committee based on GPA and the proposal. </p>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Unit Considerations </h3>
				<p>Except for the two-unit graduate seminar, this honors program does not increase a participant&#8217;s total unit requirements. The honors project will satisfy the departmental design requirement and students may use four units of their honors project course as a technical elective.		</p>
				<h2>Five-Year BS/MS Program </h2>
                <p>Undergraduates in the ECE department who have maintained a good academic record in both departmental and overall course work are encouraged to participate in the five-year BS/MS program offered by the department. Participation in the program will permit students to complete the requirements for the MS degree within one year following receipt of the BS degree. Complete details regarding admission to and participation in the program are available from the ECE Undergraduate Affairs office. </p>
        <h3>Admission to the Program </h3>
                <p>Students should submit an application for the BS/MS program, including three letters of recommendation, by the program deadline during the spring quarter of their junior year. Applications are available from the ECE Undergraduate Affairs office. No GRE’s are required for application to the BS/MS program. A GPA of at least 3.0 both overall and in the major and strong letters of recommendation are required to be considered for program admission. </p>
                <p>In the winter quarter of the senior year, applications of students admitted to the program will be forwarded by the department to the UC San Diego Office of Graduate Studies. Each student must submit the regular graduate application fee prior to the application deadline for their application to be processed. Students who have been accepted into the BS/MS program will automatically be admitted for graduate study beginning the following fall provided they maintain an overall GPA through the winter quarter of the senior year of at least 3.0. Upper-division (up to twelve units) or graduate courses taken during the senior year that are not used to satisfy undergraduate course requirements may be counted toward the forty-eight units required for the MS degree. </p>
                <h3>Continuation in the Program </h3>
                <p>Once admitted to the BS/MS program, students must maintain a 3.0 cumulative GPA in all courses through the winter quarter of the senior year and in addition must at all times maintain a 3.0 cumulative GPA in their graduate course work. Students not satisfying these requirements may be re-evaluated for continuation in the program. </p>
                <p>Admission for graduate study through the BS/MS program will be for the Master of Science degree only. Undergraduate students wishing to continue toward the PhD degree must apply and be evaluated according to the usual procedures and criteria for admission to the PhD program. </p>
                <h3>Curriculum </h3>
                <p>Students in the five-year BS/MS program must complete the same requirements as those in the regular MS program. Completion of the MS degree requirements within one year following receipt of the BS degree will generally require that students begin graduate course work in their senior year. All requirements for the BS degree should be completed by the end of the senior (fourth) year, and the BS degree awarded prior to the start of the fifth year. Courses taken in the senior year may be counted toward the BS degree requirements or the MS degree requirements, but not both. Students must have received their BS degree before they will be eligible to enroll as graduate students in the department. </p>
                <p>The department offers graduate programs leading to the MS, and PhD degrees in electrical engineering. Students can be admitted into ECE graduate studies through either the MS or PhD programs.</p>
                <p>The PhD program is strongly research oriented and is for students whose final degree objective is the PhD. If a student with a BS is admitted to this program, he or she will be expected to complete the requirements for the MS degree (outlined below) before beginning doctoral research. The MS is a technically intensive, research-oriented degree intended as preparation for advanced technical work in the engineering profession, or subsequent pursuit of a PhD. </p>
                <p>In addition, the department offers MS and PhD programs in computer engineering jointly with CSE, and a PhD program in applied ocean science jointly with MAE and Scripps Institution of Oceanography. </p>
                <p>Admission to an ECE graduate program is in accordance with the general requirements of the UC San Diego graduate division, and requires at least a BS degree in engineering, physical sciences, or mathematics with a minimum upper-division GPA of 3.0. Applicants must provide three letters of recommendation and recent GRE General Test scores. TOEFL or IELTS scores are required from international applicants whose native language is not English. Applicants should be aware that the university does not permit duplication of degrees. </p>
                <p><strong>Support:</strong> The department makes every effort to provide financial support for PhD students who are making satisfactory progress. Support may take the form of a fellowship, teaching assistantship, research assistantship, or some combination thereof. International students will not be admitted unless there is reasonable assurance that support can be provided for the duration of their PhD program students in the MS program may also obtain support through teaching or research assistantships, but this is less certain. </p>
                <p><strong>Advising:</strong> Students should seek advice on requirements and procedures from the departmental graduate office and/or the departmental website <a href="http://ece.ucsd.edu" target="_blank">http://ece.ucsd.edu</a>. All students will be assigned a faculty academic adviser upon admission and are strongly encouraged to discuss their academic program with their adviser immediately upon arrival and subsequently at least once per academic year. </p>
