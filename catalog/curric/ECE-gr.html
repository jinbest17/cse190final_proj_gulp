<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Master of Science </h3>
				<p>The ECE department offers MS programs in electrical and computer engineering. The MS programs are research oriented and are intended to provide the intensive technical preparation necessary for advanced technical work in the engineering profession or subsequent pursuit of a PhD. The MS may be earned either with a thesis (Plan 1) or with a comprehensive examination (Plan 2). However, continuation in the PhD program requires a comprehensive examination so most students opt for Plan 2. </p>
				<p><strong>Course Requirements: </strong>The total course requirements for the master of science degrees in electrical engineering and computer engineering are forty-eight units (twelve quarter courses), respectively, of which at least thirty-six units must be in graduate courses. Note that this is greater than the minimum requirements of the university. The department maintains a list of core courses for each disciplinary area from which the thirty-six graduate course units must be selected. The current list may be obtained from the department graduate office or the official website of the department. Students in interdisciplinary programs may select other core courses with the approval of their academic adviser. The course requirements must be completed within two years of full-time study. Students will be assigned a faculty adviser who will help select courses and approve their overall academic curriculum.</p>
				<p><strong>Degree Requirements:</strong> Only upper-division (100-level) and graduate (200-level) courses in which a student is assigned grades A, B, or C (including plus [+] or minus [–]) can be used to satisfy degree requirements. The forty-eight units of required course work must be taken for a letter grade, except in cases where students take ECE 299, the ECE graduate research course. Graduate research courses in the Irwin and Joan Jacobs School of Engineering may be counted toward the degree. Graduate research courses from other departments may be counted toward the degree with curriculum adviser approval. Graduate research courses (i.e., ECE 299) are the only courses where the S/U grading option is allowed. Students must maintain a GPA of 3.0 overall.  </p>
				<div>
				  <div> </div>
	    </div>
<div>
      <div> </div>
      </div>
<p><strong>Thesis and Comprehensive Requirements: </strong>The department offers both MS Plan 1 (thesis) and MS Plan 2 (written comprehensive exam). Students in the MS program must select either Plan 1 or Plan 2 by their fourth quarter of study. Students in the MS Plan 1 (thesis) must take twelve units of ECE 299 (Research) and must submit a thesis as described in the general requirements of the university. Students in the MS Plan 2 (written comprehensive exam) may count four units of ECE 299 (Research) toward the thirty-six graduate units required and must attempt to pass the departmental written comprehensive examination not later than the fall quarter of their second year of study. Students who pass the written examination at the MS level will receive a terminal master’s degree if they do not already have one. </p>
				
				<p><strong>Transfer to the PhD Program: </strong>Students in the MS program wishing to be considered for admission to the PhD program should consult their academic adviser as soon as possible. Students must notify department of their intent to transfer by their fourth quarter of study. Transfer from the MS to the PhD program is possible provided that the student</p>
               
<ul>
		<li class="list-level-1">Satisfy all requirements for initial admission to the PhD program, including submission of GRE general test scores, and be approved for consideration for transfer to the PhD program by the ECE Graduate Admissions Committee. </li>
		<li class="list-level-1">Identify a faculty member who agrees, in writing, to serve as that student&#8217;s academic and PhD research adviser. </li>
		<li class="list-level-1">In consultation with the academic adviser, design and complete a program of course work that satisfies all course requirements and constraints for a PhD discipline appropriate to the student&#8217;s research. All students in the PhD program are required to satisfy all PhD requirements as described below. Should the student not be admitted to the PhD program, this program of course work will serve, with the approval of the academic adviser and the ECE Graduate Affairs Committee, to satisfy the course work requirements for the MS. </li>
		<li class="list-level-1">Pass the preliminary (comprehensive) examination at the level required for continuation in the PhD program. A student failing to pass the comprehensive exam at this required level will not be admitted to the PhD program, and will instead continue in the MS program. </li>
		<li class="list-level-1">Maintain a GPA of at least 3.4 in the appropriate core graduate courses. </li>
	  </ul>
				<p>A student who has fulfilled all of the above requirements should, after passing the departmental PhD preliminary (comprehensive) exam, submit a petition to change his or her degree objective from MS to PhD. </p>
        <h3>Master of Advanced Studies </h3>
        <p>The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering offers the master of advanced studies (MAS) degree in Wireless Embedded Systems (WES). The degree requires thirty-six units of work, including a capstone team project. This program is for part-time students with an adequate background in engineering. All the requirements can be completed in two years, with one or two courses taken each quarter.</p>
        <p><strong>Final Project Capstone Requirement, No Thesis: </strong>In the MAS-WES program, an &ldquo;alternative plan&rdquo; requirement is satisfied by a four-unit capstone project requirement.</p>
        <p><strong>Required Courses:</strong> Students entering the MAS program in Electrical and Computer Engineering for a degree in Wireless Embedded Systems will undertake courses in the Wireless Embedded Systems program.</p>
<p>The program requires eight four-unit core courses totaling thirty-two units and one four-unit capstone team project course for a total of thirty-six units.</p>
        <p>All courses must be completed with an average grade of B. The courses required of all students are as follows:</p>

<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">The Doctoral Programs </h3>
				<p>The ECE department offers graduate programs leading to the PhD in twelve disciplines within electrical and computer engineering, as described in detail below. The PhD is a research degree requiring completion of the PhD program course requirements, satisfactory performance on the comprehensive (PhD preliminary) examination and university qualifying examination, and submission and defense of a doctoral thesis (as described under the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.ucsd.edu/catalog/front/GradStud.html">Graduate Admission</a>&rdquo; section of this catalog). Students in the PhD program must pass the comprehensive exam (PhD preliminary) before the beginning of the winter quarter of the second year of graduate study. To ensure timely progress in their research, students are strongly encouraged to identify a faculty member willing to supervise their doctoral research by the end of their first year of study. </p>
<p>Students should begin defining and preparing for their thesis research
				  as soon as they have passed the comprehensive exam (PhD preliminary).
				  They should plan on taking the university qualifying examination
				  about one year later. The university does not permit students to continue
				  in graduate study for more than four years without passing this examination.
				  At the qualifying examination the student will give an oral
				  presentation on research accomplishments to date and the thesis proposal
				  to a campuswide committee. The committee will decide if the work and proposal
				  has adequate content and reasonable chance for success. They may require
		  that the student modify the proposal and may require a further review. </p>
				<p>The final PhD requirements are the submission of a dissertation and
				  the dissertation defense (as described under the “<a href="../front/GradAdmission.html">Graduate
				  Admission</a>” section
  of this catalog). </p>
				<p><strong class="myriad-pro-semibold">Course Requirements: </strong>The
				  total course requirements for the PhD in electrical engineering
				  are essentially the same as the MS  and consist of forty-eight
				  units (twelve quarter courses), of which at least thirty-six units must
				  be in graduate courses. Note that this is greater than the minimum requirements
				  of the university. The department maintains a list of core courses for
				  each disciplinary area from which the thirty-six graduate course units
				  must be selected. The current list may be obtained from the ECE department
				  graduate office or the official website of the department. Students in
				  the interdisciplinary programs may select other core courses with the approval
				  of their academic adviser. The course requirements must be completed within
				  two years of full-time study. </p>
				<p>Students in the PhD programs may count no more than eight units of ECE
				  299 toward their course requirements. </p>
				<p>Students who already hold an MS in electrical engineering must nevertheless satisfy the requirements for the core courses. However, graduate courses taken elsewhere can be substituted for specific courses with the approval of the academic adviser. </p>
				<p><strong>Degree Requirements:</strong> Only upper-division (100-level) and graduate (200-level) courses in which a student is assigned grades A, B, or C (including plus [+] or minus [–]) can be used to satisfy degree requirements.&nbsp;The forty-eight units of required course work must be taken for a letter grade, except in cases where students take ECE 299, the ECE graduate research course. Graduate research courses in the Jacobs School may be counted toward the degree. Graduate research courses from other departments may be counted toward the degree with curriculum adviser approval. Graduate research courses (i.e., ECE 299) are the only courses where the S/U grading option is allowed. Students must maintain a GPA of 3.0 overall. In addition, a GPA of 3.4 in the core graduate courses is generally expected.  </p>

<p><strong class="myriad-pro-semibold">Comprehensive Exam (PhD Preliminary): </strong>PhD students must find a faculty member who will agree to supervise their thesis research. This should be done before the start of the second year of study. They should then devote at least half their time to research and must pass the PhD preliminary examination before the beginning of the winter quarter of the second year of study. This is an oral exam in which the student presents his or her research to a committee of three ECE faculty members and is examined orally for proficiency in his or her area of specialization. The outcome of the exam is based on the student&rsquo;s research presentation, proficiency demonstrated in the student&rsquo;s area of specialization and overall academic record and performance in the graduate program. Successful completion of the PhD preliminary examination will also satisfy the MS Plan 2 comprehensive exam requirement. </p>

				  a year after passing the comprehensive exam (PhD preliminary).
				  The university does not permit students to continue in graduate study for
				  more than four years without passing this examination. The university qualifying
				  examination is an oral exam in which the student presents his or her thesis
				  proposal to a campuswide committee. After passing this
				  exam the student is “advanced to candidacy.” </p>
				<p><strong class="myriad-pro-semibold">Dissertation Defense: </strong>The
				  final PhD requirements are the submission of a dissertation, and the
				  dissertation defense (as described under the “<a href="../front/GradAdmission.html">Graduate

                  <li><strong class="myriad-pro-semibold">Computer Engineering: </strong>This program consists
                    of balanced programs of studies in both hardware and software,
                    the premise being that knowledge and skill in both areas
                    are essential both for the modern-day computer engineer to make the proper
                    unbiased tradeoffs in design, and for researchers to consider all paths
                    toward the solution of research questions and problems. Toward these
                    ends, the programs emphasize studies (course work) and competency (comprehensive
                    examinations, and dissertations or projects) in the areas
                    of VLSI and logic design, and reliable computer and communication systems.

                      and Control:</strong> This
                    information sciences-based field is concerned with the design
                    of human-interactive intelligent systems that can sense
                    the world (defined as some specified domain of interest);
                    represent or model the world; detect and identify states
                    and events in the world; reason about and make decisions about the
                    world; and/or act on the world, perhaps all in real-time. A sense of
                    the type of systems and applications encountered in this discipline
                    can be obtained by viewing the projects shown at the <a href="http://ece.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">ECE department</a> website.
</p>
                    
                    <p> The development of such sophisticated systems is necessarily an interdisciplinary
                      activity. To sense and succinctly represent events in the
                      world requires knowledge of signal processing, computer vision, information
                      theory, coding theory, and databasing; to detect and reason about
                      states of the world utilizes concepts from statistical detection theory,
                      hypothesis testing, pattern recognition, time series analysis, and
                      artificial intelligence; to make good decisions about highly complex
                      systems requires knowledge of traditional mathematical optimization
                      theory and contemporary near-optimal approaches such as evolutionary
                      computation; and to act upon the world requires familiarity with concepts
                      of control theory and robotics. Very often learning and adaptation
                      are required—as either critical aspects of the world are poorly known
                      at the outset, and must be refined online, or the world is nonstationary
                      and our system must constantly adapt to it as it evolves. In addition
                      to the theoretical information and computer science aspects, many important
                      hardware and software issues must be addressed in order to obtain an
                      effective fusion of a complicated suite of sensors, computers, and
                    problem dynamics into one integrated system.</p>
                    Faculty affiliated with the ISRC subarea are involved in virtually
