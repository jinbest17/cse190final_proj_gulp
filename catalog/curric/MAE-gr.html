<p>The Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE) at UC San Diego offers
  graduate instruction leading to the <strong>MS and PhD in engineering
  sciences </strong>with a designated specialization in each of the following
  areas: aerospace engineering, applied mechanics, applied ocean sciences, engineering
  physics, and mechanical engineering. </p>
<p>In fall 2007, a new PhD specialization was introduced: computational science.
  Computational science seeks to gain understanding principally through the analysis
  of mathematical models on high performance computers.&nbsp;It is a blend of
  applications, computations, and mathematics. It is a mode of scientific investigation
  that supplements the traditional lab and theoretical models of acquiring knowledge.
  This is done by formulating mathematical models whose solutions are approximated
  by computer simulations.</p>
<p>The computational science specialization leverages the strength of the existing mathematics, science, and engineering departments. PhD students must demonstrate advanced undergraduate-level proficiency in numerical analysis and in computer algorithms and data structures.</p>
<p>For more information, please contact the MAE Graduate Affairs Office at <a href="mailto:mae-gradadm-l@ucsd.edu">mae-gradadm-l@ucsd.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Admission to the graduate program is in accordance with the general requirements
  of the graduate division, which requires a BS and/or MS in some
  branch of engineering, the physical sciences, or mathematics; an overall GPA
  of 3.0; and three letters of recommendation from individuals who can attest
  to the applicant’s academic or professional competence and to the depth of
  their interest in pursuing graduate study. In addition, all applicants are
  required to submit GRE General Test scores. </p>
<p>A minimum score of 550 on the paper based (80 on the IBT or 7 on the IELTS) Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)
  is required of all international applicants whose native language is not English
  and whose undergraduate education was conducted in a language other than English.
  Students who score below 600 on the TOEFL examination are strongly encouraged
  to enroll in an English as a second language program before beginning graduate
  work. (UC San Diego Extension offers an excellent English language program
  during the summer as well as the academic year.) </p>
<p>Applicants are judged competitively. Based on the candidate&rsquo;s background, qualifications, and goals, admission to the program is in one of two categories: MS or PhD. The MS designation is reserved for students currently interested in obtaining an MS but who at a later time may wish to continue in the doctoral program. Admission to the PhD program is reserved for qualified students whose final aim is a doctoral degree. An MS can be obtained during the PhD program. Policies for possible changes in status
  are given under “<a href="#masters">Master’s Degree Program</a>” below. </p>
<p>For more information on admission to our graduate program, please go to <a href="http://maeweb.ucsd.edu/grad/admissions" target="_blank">http://maeweb.ucsd.edu/grad/admissions</a>.</p>
<p>Nonmatriculated students are welcome to seek enrollment in MAE courses via
  UC San Diego’s Extension’s Concurrent Enrollment program but an extension student’s
  enrollment in an MAE graduate course must be approved by the instructor. </p>
		<p class="anchor-parent"><a class="anchor" id="masters"></a></p><h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">Master&#8217;s Degree Program</h2>
				<p>The MS program is intended to extend and broaden an undergraduate background
				  and/or equip practicing engineers with fundamental knowledge
				  in their particular fields. The degree may be terminal or obtained on
				  the way to the PhD. The degree is offered under both the Thesis Plan I
				  and the Comprehensive Examination Plan II (see “<a href="../front/GradAdmission.html#master">Graduate
				  Admission: Master’s Degrees</a>”). A strong effort is made to schedule MS
				  level course offerings so that students may obtain their MS in one year of full-time study or two years of part-time study. </p>
                <p><strong>MS Time Limit Policy: </strong>Full-time MS students
                  are permitted seven quarters in which to complete all requirements.
                  While there are no written time limits for part-time students,
                  the department has the right to intervene and set individual
                  deadlines if it becomes necessary. </p>
        <h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Master&#8217;s Plan I—Thesis Defense</h3>
				<p>This plan of study involves both course work and research, culminating
				  in the preparation of a thesis. A total of thirty-six units
				  of credit is required: twenty-four units (six courses)
				  must be in course work, and twelve units must be in research (MAE 299).
				  The student’s program is arranged, with prior approval of the
				  faculty adviser, according to the following policies:</p>
<ol>
      <li>Course work must include at least sixteen units (four courses) of MAE
	      200-level courses. </li>
        <li>Units obtained in MAE 205 or 299 may not be applied toward the course
          work requirement. </li>
        <li>No more than a total of eight units of MAE 296 and 298 may be applied
          toward the course work requirement. </li>
        <li>No more than twelve units of upper-division 100-level courses (engineering-based
          or technically serious) may be applied toward the course work requirement. </li>
        <li>Only four units from the ENG series may be applied to the degree.</li>
        <li>Twelve units of MAE 299 must be taken to fulfill the research requirement.</li>
</ol>
<p>The thirty-six units are arranged into three areas of specialization, organized
  as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Specialization 1: Three courses (four units each course)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Specialization 2: Three courses (four units each course)</li>
  <li>Specialization 3: Twelve units of MAE 299</li>
</ul>
<p>The two areas of specialization must be chosen from the
  list below of MAE research areas. The third specialization can be one of the
  listed MAE areas or a math/science area.</p>
<h4>Current MAE Research Areas</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Applied and Solid Mechanics</li>
  <li>Material Sciences</li>
  <li>Fluid Mechanics</li>
  <li>Thermal Sciences</li>
  <li>Engineering Physics</li>
  <li>Dynamics Systems and Controls</li>
  <li>Environmental Engineering</li>
  <li>Biomechanics</li>
  <li>Design</li>
</ul>
<p>Students should reference the <a href="http://mae.ucsd.edu/sites/mae.ucsd.edu/files/Graduate%20Course%20Structure%20REV%202015.pdf" target="_blank">MAE Graduate Course Structure</a> to see which courses
  fall into which of the research areas.</p>
<p>Students must maintain at least a B average (3.00 GPA) in the courses taken to fulfill the degree requirements. All required courses for a degree must be taken for a letter grade, with the exception of MAE 299 research units, which may be taken as S/U only. A thesis based on the research is written and subsequently reviewed by the thesis adviser and two other faculty members appointed by the dean of Graduate Studies. The review is normally an oral defense of the thesis. </p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Comprehensive Examination—Plan II </h3>
				<p>This plan of study involves course work only and culminates in a comprehensive written examination. A total of&nbsp;thirty-six units of credit (nine courses) are required. The student&rsquo;s program is arranged, with prior approval of the faculty adviser, according to the following policies:</p>
<ol>
  <li>At      least twenty units (five courses)  of MAE 200-level courses. </li>
  <li>Units      obtained in MAE 205 or 299 may not be applied toward the course work      requirements. </li>
  <li>No      more than a total of eight units of MAE 296 and 298 may be applied toward      the degree requirements. </li>
  <li>No      more than twelve units of upper-division 100-level courses      (engineering-based or technically serious) may be applied toward the degree      requirements. </li>
  <li>Only      four units from the ENG series may be applied to the degree.</li>
  
</ol>

                <p>These&nbsp;thirty-six units should be arranged into three areas of requirements,  organized as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Required      Course: One course (4 units):</li>
                    <ul type="circle">
                      <li>MAE       208. Mathematics for Engineers</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Emphasis      Courses: Four courses (4 units each) from the following list:</li>
                    <ul type="circle">
                      <li>MAE       200. Controls</li>

                      <li>MAE       204. Robotics</li>
                      <li>MAE       206. Energy Systems</li>
                      <li>MAE       209. Continuum Mechanics Applied to Medicine/Biology</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Permitted      Electives: Four courses (4 units each) from the <a href="http://mae.ucsd.edu/sites/mae.ucsd.edu/files/Graduate%20Course%20Structure%20REV%202015.pdf" target="_blank">MAE      Graduate Student Course Structure</a></li>
                </ul>
        <p>The <strong>Comprehensive Examination </strong>is a formal, written exam. It will include two to three questions from each of the required emphasis courses. The exam will be offered once in mid- to late spring quarter, and a make-up exam will be offered again in summer. If the exam is not completed with a passing grade, the student will be allowed to retake the exam one time within a twelve-month period. If the student fails a second time, he or she will not be awarded the MS degree. </p>
<p>Students must maintain at least a B average (3.00 GPA) in the courses taken to fulfill the degree requirements. All required courses for a degree must be taken for a letter grade, with the exception of MAE 299 research units, which may be taken as S/U only.</p>
<div>
      <div> </div>
      <div> </div>
      <div> </div>
      </div>
<p><strong>Change of Degree</strong>. Upon completion of the
                  requirements for the MS, students admitted as MS
                  only or MS candidates are not automatically eligible for
                  admission to the PhD program. MS only candidates who subsequently
                  wish to pursue a doctorate must submit an application for a
                  change in status to their examining committee. If the recommendation
                  is positive and the request approved, the student must submit
                  a general petition for graduate students to effect the change
                  of status. In addition, the examining committee may recommend
                  that the examination satisfy one of the three topics required
                  in the departmental qualifying examination for the doctorate.                </p>
                <p>MS candidates who subsequently wish to pursue a doctorate must also submit an application for a change in status to their examining committee. In this case, a special examination is not required. The application, however, must be approved and signed by an MAE faculty member who expects to serve as the student&rsquo;s PhD adviser. When the request is approved, the student must submit a general petition for graduate students to effect the change of status. If the student elects the comprehensive examination plan for the MS, this examination may be used not only to fulfill the requirement for the MS, but also to satisfy one of the three topics required in the departmental qualifying examination for the doctorate. In fact, the MS examination may be part of the doctoral examination.</p>

<h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">Doctoral Degree Program </h2>
				<p>The MAE PhD program is intended to prepare students for a variety of
				  careers in research and teaching. Therefore, depending on the
				  student’s background and ability, research is initiated as soon as possible.
				  In general, there are no formal course requirements for the PhD. All students,
				  in consultation with their advisers, develop course programs that will
				  prepare them for the MAE Departmental Qualifying Examination and for their
				  dissertation research. However, these programs of study and research must
				  be planned to meet the time limits established to advance to candidacy
				  and to complete the requirements for the degree. Doctoral students who
				  have passed the Departmental Examination may take any course for an S/U
				  grade, with the exception of any course that the student’s Departmental
				  or PhD Qualifying Examination Committee stipulates must be taken in order
				  to remove a deficiency. It is strongly recommended that all MAE graduate
				  students take a minimum of two courses (other than research) per academic
				  year after passing the Departmental Qualifying Examination. Specific details
				  in this regard can be obtained from the MAE Student Affairs Office. </p>
                <p><strong>Doctoral Examinations: </strong>An MAE PhD student
                is required to pass three examinations. The first is a <strong>Departmental
                Qualifying Examination (DQE)</strong> that is intended to determine
                the candidate’s ability to successfully pursue a research project
                level appropriate for the doctorate. This first exam must be
                taken within the first six quarters of registration as a graduate
                student. The DQE is an oral examination by a committee of four
                persons (two of which must be in the MAE department) and is based
                on material taught over thirty-six units in three areas of study: a major
                area (four courses), a minor area (two introductory courses),
                and a study in mathematics or basic science (three courses).
                Students must submit a plan of study, approved by their adviser,
                to the Graduate Affairs Committee for final approval by the end
                of their second quarter of graduate study.
				</p>
                <p>Students should reference the MAE <a href="http://mae.ucsd.edu/sites/mae.ucsd.edu/files/Graduate%20Course%20Structure%20REV%202015.pdf" target="_blank">Graduate Course Structure</a> for a plan of study and to see which courses fall into which of the research areas.</p>
                <div>
                  <div> </div>
                </div>
<p><strong>Teaching Experience</strong> is required of all MAE
                  PhD students prior to taking the PhD Qualifying Exam. The
                  teaching experience is defined as lecturing one hour per week
                  in either a problem-solving section or regular lecture for
                  one quarter in a course designated by the department. The requirement
                  can be fulfilled by teaching assistant service or taken as
                  a course for academic credit (MAE 501). Students must contact
                the Student Affairs Office to plan for completion of this requirement. </p>
                <p>The <strong>PhD Qualifying Examination</strong> is the second
                  examination required of MAE PhD students. In preparation for
                  the PhD Qualifying Examination, students must have completed
                  the Departmental Qualifying Examination and the Departmental
                  Teaching Experience requirement, obtained a faculty research
                  adviser, and have identified a topic for their dissertation
                  research and have made initial progress. At the time of application
                  for advancement to candidacy, a doctoral committee responsible
                  for the remainder of the student’s graduate program is appointed
                  by the Graduate Council. The committee conducts the PhD Qualifying
                  Examination, during which students must demonstrate the ability
                  to engage in dissertation research. This involves the presentation
                  of a plan for the dissertation research project. The committee
                  may ask questions directly or indirectly related to the project
                  and general questions that it determines to be relevant. Upon
                  successful completion of this examination, students are advanced
                  to candidacy and are awarded the candidate in philosophy degree
                  (see “<a href="../front/GradAdmission.html">Graduate Admission</a>”
                  section in this catalog). The <strong>Dissertation Defense</strong> is
                  the final PhD examination. Upon completion of the dissertation
                  research project, the student writes a dissertation that must
                  be successfully defended in an oral examination and public
                  presentation conducted by the doctoral committee. A complete
                  copy of the student’s dissertation must be submitted to each
                  member of the doctoral committee approximately four weeks before
                  the defense. It is understood that the copy of the dissertation
                  given to committee members will not be the final copy, and
                  that the committee members may suggest changes in the text
                  at the time of the defense. This examination may not be conducted
                  earlier than three quarters after the date of advancement to
                  doctoral candidacy. Acceptance of the dissertation by the Office
                  of Graduate Studies and the university librarian represents
                  the final step in completion of all requirements for the PhD. </p>
                <p>There is no formal foreign language requirement for doctoral
                  candidates. Students are expected to master whatever language
                  is needed for the pursuit of their own research. </p>
                <p><strong>PhD Time Limit Policy.</strong> Precandidacy status
                  is limited to four years. Doctoral students are eligible for
                  university support for six years (engineering physics, seven
                  years). The defense and submission of the doctoral dissertation
          must be within seven years (engineering physics, eight years).</p>
                <p><strong>Evaluations.</strong> In the spring of each year,
                  faculty advisers evaluate each doctoral student’s overall performance
                  in course work, research during the past academic year, and
                  prospects for financial support for the next year. A written
                  assessment is given to the student. If a student’s work is
                  found to be inadequate, the faculty adviser may determine that
                  the student cannot continue in the doctoral program and will
                  recommend dismissal to the dean of Graduate Studies. </p>
