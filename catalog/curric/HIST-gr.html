<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">The Master&#8217;s Program </h3>
				<p>The master's program is designed to introduce students to the basic skills of historical research as well as to the debates about, and the approaches to, historical scholarship in a specific field. Master&#8217;s students ordinarily do not receive financial aid from the department or the university except when funds are not utilized for support of doctoral candidates.</p>
				<p>The department offers master&rsquo;s degrees in European history, United States history, and history of science. In addition, the Department of History administers an interdisciplinary master's program in Jewish studies. Students interested in pursuing a master&rsquo;s degree in Latin American history are encouraged to apply for admission to the Latin American studies program.  The department also offers the opportunity for students to design special master's programs in areas such as African history or medieval European history. In consultation with an appropriate faculty member, students may petition the department for approval of a special MA. </p>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Admissions</h4>
				<p>Admission is based on the applicant&#8217;s undergraduate preparation; previous graduate work, if any; three letters of recommendation; one or two papers (preferably written for history courses); and scores from the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). The GRE subject exam in history is not required. The Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) is required for foreign applicants. A minimum score of 550 for the paper-based test, a score of 213 for the computer-based test, or a score of 80 on the internet-based test is required on the TOEFL. The minimum grade point average for admission is 3.0 with a higher average in history and related subjects. Refer to the online application for filing deadline.</p>
				<p>For the online application, visit <a href="http://grad.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">http://grad.ucsd.edu/</a>.</p>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">General Requirements </h4>
				<p>The master&#8217;s program can be completed in one year of full-time study or two years of half-time study and includes nine four-unit courses (thirty-six units) in a major field. Required courses vary for each major field (see below), but all courses must be taken for a letter grade. With very few exceptions, students are expected to begin their programs in the fall quarter. In addition to the course requirements, completion of the MA requires that students pass a one-hour oral examination at the end of their final quarter of enrollment. </p>
				<p>Language requirement: While proficiency in a foreign language is only required in European history (see below), prospective applicants are strongly urged to begin study of a foreign language appropriate to the proposed area of concentration as early as possible in their academic career.</p>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Area of Concentration: Jewish Studies</h4>
				<p>Jewish Studies is an interdisciplinary program that allows students interested
				  in many areas to build a coordinated graduate program leading to an MA.
				  Courses that count toward the degree may be in a wide array of university
				  programs and departments, including history, literature, anthropology,
				  political sciences, sociology, and philosophy.</p>
		<ol class="upper-alpha">
		  <li> Admission Requirements</li>
		  <ol> <li>BA or equivalent.</li>
		    <li>Two years of course work in the language or languages appropriate
		    to the field of Jewish studies.</li>
		    <li>Applicants should apply through
		      the Department of History.</li>
		  </ol>
		  <li>Degree Requirements</li>
		 <ol> <li>The MA will be granted for thirty-six credits, ordinarily
		    completed in one or two years.</li>
		  <li>Students may enroll in no more than two undergraduate courses. All
	      courses should be approved by the faculty mentor of the student.		    </li></ol>
	    </ol>
<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Area of Concentration: Europe </h4>
		<p>Candidates for the MA in European history pursue a program concentrating on the history of early modern and modern Europe. Some training in a discipline other than history is also recommended. The requirement of nine courses (thirty-six units) is normally distributed as follows:</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>A two-quarter research seminar, either HIGR 230 or 231.</li>
				  <li>Cross-field historiography course: HIGR 200.</li>
				  <li>European historiography courses: HIGR 220, 221, and/or 222. Each
				    year one to two of these historiography courses are offered,
				    and the student must take these.</li>
				  <li>Two courses in preindustrial Europe, 1450–1750: HIGR 220 and 221,
				    or HIGR 230 may be counted for this distribution requirement.</li>
				  <li>Two courses in industrial Europe since 1750: HIGR 221, 222, or HIGR
				    231 may be counted for this requirement, as well as appropriate
				    graduate level colloquia.<br />
				    <strong>Note: </strong>HIGR 221 may NOT be used for both (3) AND
				    (4).</li>
				  <li>One course in a discipline other than history, if relevant to the
				    student&#8217;s program.</li>
				  <li>The remaining courses may be chosen, in consultation with the graduate
				    adviser in the student&#8217;s field, from among the available undergraduate/graduate
				    colloquia (#260S–280S).</li>
	    </ol>
				<p>Language requirement: MA candidates in European history must demonstrate reading competency in one European language other than English.</p>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Area of Concentration: History of Science </h4>
		<p>The master&#8217;s program in history of science provides a broad background in preparation for a variety of careers related to science and technology, business, journalism, education, government, or for more advanced degree work. The nine courses (thirty-six units) required are normally distributed as follows:</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Two courses in science in early modern Europe.</li>
				  <li>Two courses in science since 1750.</li>
				  <li>A two-quarter research seminar.</li>
				  <li>The remaining courses are chosen in consultation with the faculty
				    in history of science. For students whose previous training
				    has been mainly scientific, these will include courses in
				    historical fields other than the history of science. For students who
				    already have historical training, they may include one or more courses
				    related to the sciences.</li>
	    </ol>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Area of Concentration: Latin America </h4>
		<p>This program offers the student a general preparation in the history of Latin America. Students will have the opportunity to specialize in national or colonial periods and can emphasize work in one country. Advanced work in another discipline related to Latin America may also be included in the program. Thirty-six units normally should be distributed as follows:</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>HILA 267, 268, 269</li>
				  <li>Three graduate courses in Latin American history</li>
				  <li>Three other courses related to Latin America in history or in other
				    disciplines</li>
	    </ol>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Area of Concentration: United States </h4>
		<p>This area of concentration offers the master's candidate a broad grounding in the literature of American history from the colonial period to the present. In addition to a shared core of courses, students specialize in a topical field of their own choosing. Training in a related discipline outside of history is encouraged. The requirement of nine courses (thirty-six units) is ordinarily distributed as follows:</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>HIGR 265A-B-C. The Literature of American History. These colloquia
				    are required of all entering graduate students in American
				    history.</li>
				  <li>A two-quarter research seminar.</li>
				  <li>Two courses in a single topical field chosen from African-American
				    history, Asian American history, Atlantic history, history
				    of the borderlands and Southwest, Chicano history, economic
				    history, legal and constitutional history, political history, social
				    and cultural history, history of the South, history of the West, or history
				    of women, gender, and sexuality.</li>
				  <li>Two additional courses chosen in consultation with the student&#8217;s
				    adviser. These courses may be in a related field outside
				    the department.</li>
				  <li>At least six of the nine courses must be colloquia or graduate-level
				    courses. Students may take conjoined courses, directed readings,
				    research seminars, or the 265 series to meet this requirement.</li>
	    </ol>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Doctoral Program </h3>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Admission </h4>
				<p>The Department of History offers the doctor of philosophy degree in the fields of ancient history, East Asian history, European history, history of science, Latin American history, Middle Eastern history, and United States history. Applicants must indicate to which of these programs they seek admission.</p>
				<p>Admission is based on the applicant&#8217;s undergraduate preparation; previous graduate work, if any; three letters of recommendation; one or two writing samples (preferably written for history courses); and scores from the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). The GRE subject exam in history is not required. The Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) is required for foreign applicants. A minimum score of 550 for the paper-based test or a score of 213 for the computer-based test is required on the TOEFL. The minimum grade point average for admission is 3.0 with a higher average in history and related subjects. With very few exceptions, students are expected to begin their programs in the fall quarter.</p>
				<p>In most areas of concentration, knowledge of at least two foreign languages
				  will be required during a student&#8217;s academic career. In general,
				  applicants are expected to have a reading knowledge of the
				  languages most appropriate to their major field at the time
				  of admission. Thus, students in ancient history, East Asian
				  history, European history, history of science, Latin American
				  history, and Middle Eastern history should have a working knowledge
				  of <i>at least</i> one foreign language at the time of admission.
  Refer to the online application for filing deadline.</p>

				<h5 class="program-overview-subhead-4">VIII. Dual Degree Program </h5>
				<p>Students who wish to earn both the PhD in history from UC San Diego
				  and the Juris Doctor from California Western School of Law must
				  apply to and be independently accepted into both programs under
				  each of the campus&#8217; standards
				  and procedures.</p>
				<p>Students pursuing the dual degree program will normally alternate years at each institution, in a manner agreed on by the student&#8217;s advisers and appropriate committees. Thus, for example, a student may spend his or her first year at Cal Western, his or her second year at UC San Diego, and so on through the program. At least one year at each institution must be completed by the end of three years.</p>
				<p>Each institution will accept a small number of course credits from the other institution to satisfy its degree requirements. Cal Western remains on a semester system, while UC San Diego continues on a quarter system. With the exception of the historiography and research seminars and subject to approval by a faculty adviser and the graduate committee, the Department of History will accept for credit up to two classes from Cal Western.</p>
				<h5 class="program-overview-subhead-4">IX. Other Fields </h5>
				<p>Students may be admitted to graduate study leading to the PhD in fields other than those listed above upon the recommendation of an appropriate faculty member. In such cases, a special program of study appropriate to the field will be devised by the major field adviser, subject to the approval of the department&#8217;s graduate committee.</p>
				<p><strong>Note: </strong>The department also offers graduate work in African history. When appropriate, students may select a minor field in this area.</p>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">PhD Course Work </h4>
				<p>A normal full-time program consists of twelve units (or three four-unit courses) per quarter. Doctoral students are expected to complete at least one of the following minimum formal courses of study prior to their qualifying examination: (1) two two-quarter research seminars, three one-quarter historiography courses in their major field, and five other courses (which may be a combination of colloquia, conjoined courses, or directed readings, but which must include one cross-field graduate colloquium like HIGR 200); or (2) three two-quarter research seminars (not necessarily in the same field), three one-quarter historiography courses in their major field, and three other courses (which may be a combination of colloquia, conjoined courses, or directed readings, but which must include one cross-field graduate colloquium like HIGR 200). Students are encouraged to take their first research seminar in their major field during the initial year of graduate study. After the first year, most students&#8217; full-time program includes two regular academic courses each quarter (eight units) and employment as a 50 percent teaching assistant (four units). </p>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Cross-Field Thematic Graduate Colloquia</h4>
				<p class="basic-offset-bottom-only">In addition to the graduate courses offered by the field groups, the department will offer at least one and up to three cross-field colloquia each year, which are designed to cross geographical and chronological boundaries. Two of these courses are taught at least every other year under this rubric:</p>
				<p class="course-list-overview">HIGR 200. History and Theory [required for U.S., Europe, and L.A.] </p>
				<p class="basic-offset-bottom-only">An introductory graduate course for students in all fields. Themes include cross-field historiography and theory, interdisciplinary approaches to history and historical method. (May be taken twice for credit, if the reading list is significantly different.)</p>
				<p class="course-list-overview">HIGR 205. Feminist Historical Studies</p>
				<p class="basic-offset-bottom-only">An introduction to feminist historical
				  studies. This course will provide students with training in women&#8217;s
				  history, in the feminist theories that undergird that scholarship, and
				  in gender analysis. (May be taken twice for credit, if the reading list
				  is significantly different.)</p>
				<p class="course-list-overview">HIGR 207. Nationalism, Colonialism, and Race </p>
				<p class="basic-offset-bottom-only">A transdisciplinary and comparative course on the interplay of nationalism, colonialism, and race (as well as class and gender/sexuality) in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.</p>
				<p class="basic-offset-top-only">All doctoral students are required to complete
				  at least one cross-field graduate course (typically in the HIGR 200-HIGR
				  208 series) before advancement to candidacy. Students are strongly encouraged
				  to meet this requirement in their first year, as their field and program
	    of study permits.</p>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Part-Time Study </h4>
				<p>Students who enroll in fewer than twelve graduate or upper-division units per quarter are considered part-time students. Part-time study may be pursued in several master&#8217;s programs and a few doctoral programs at UC San Diego. Approval for individual students to enroll on a part-time basis may be given for reasons of occupation, family responsibilities, or health. Individuals who are interested in part-time study and meet the above qualifications should see the department&#8217;s graduate coordinator.</p>
				<p>Part-time students must satisfy the same admission requirements as full-time students and are eligible, at the discretion of the department, for 25 percent time teaching or research assistantships. Students who are approved by the dean of Graduate Studies for enrollment in a program of half-time study or less (maximum of six units) may be eligible for a reduction in fees. All other students pay the same fees as full-time students.</p>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">PhD and MA Language Requirements </h4>
				<p>Doctoral candidates in Chinese, European, Middle Eastern, and Latin American history must demonstrate competency in two foreign languages.</p>
				<p>Doctoral candidates in history of science, Japanese, and United States history, as well as master's candidates in European and Latin American history, must demonstrate competency in one foreign language.</p>
				<p>Doctoral candidates in ancient history must demonstrate competency in two modern foreign languages as well as the relevant ancient languages.</p>
				<p>Doctoral candidates in Middle Eastern history must possess a sound foundation in reading Arabic or Turkish (Ottoman Turkish or modern Turkish) as a requirement for admission to the program. Reading competence in two languages in addition to English is required before advancement to candidacy: the regional language Arabic or Turkish above, and a modern European language (other than English) related to the major field of specialization.</p>
				<p>Additional languages appropriate to the special field of study as well as language requirements for a candidate in a field other than those already mentioned may be required by the graduate committee in consultation with the student&#8217;s major field adviser.</p>
		<p>Students may satisfy the foreign language requirement in one of the following ways:</p>
                <ol class="upper-alpha">
                  <li>By completing, with a grade of B– or better in each
                    term, a two-year language sequence from the student&#8217;s
                    undergraduate institution. Such a sequence must have been
                    completed within two years of the time the request is made
                    to the graduate committee for certification of competency.</li>
                  <li>By completing, while as a graduate student, with a satisfactory
                    (S) grade in each term, a two-year, lower-division sequence
                    in the language approved by the graduate committee.</li>
                  <li>By completing, while as a graduate student, with a satisfactory
                    (S) grade in each term, a one-year, upper-division sequence
                    in the language approved by the graduate committee.</li>
                  <li>By passing a translation examination administered by
                    the department. (This is the only option available for Chinese
                    and Japanese.)</li>
                </ol>
				<p class="list-level-1-numerical">Students are urged to complete at least one foreign language examination by the end of the first year of study and must do so by the beginning of their third year. Failure to meet this requirement is grounds for denial of financial support. No student may take the oral qualifying examination before completing all language requirements.</p>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">PhD Examinations </h4>
				<h5 class="program-overview-subhead-4">A. Minor Fields</h5>
				<p>Doctoral candidates are strongly encouraged to take at least one minor field examination by the end of the first year and to complete the second minor exam by the end of the second year. All minor fields must be completed before the major field exam can be taken. Generally, the department recognizes two types of minor fields. The first is a teaching field. That is, passing a minor field in an area certifies, on a student&#8217;s record and resume, that the student has mastered the literature and the major issues in another geographical or chronological field such that the student is qualified to teach in that area. (An example would be a minor field in modern Japanese history for an East Asian history student specializing in modern China; or early modern European history for a modern Europeanist.) A second type of minor field is designed to familiarize a student with a range of theoretical, comparative, and/or transnational issues, which will be useful in the formulation of a dissertation topic and future research in the student&#8217;s major field.</p>
				<p>In some cases, this minor field is pursued outside the department (in consultation with the student&#8217;s adviser): an example might be a minor in the Department of Ethnic Studies for a student working on race and ethnicity in the U.S. In other cases, the student may identify a faculty member or series of faculty members within the department who focus on a particular theme, such as gender, citizenship, or imperialism.</p>
				<p>The minor field is defined by a reading list agreed on by the student and the minor field adviser(s). As a guideline, the reading list should encompass about three quarters&#8217; worth of course work (which may be taken with up to three faculty members), and include about fifty titles, with forty to seventy titles representing a reasonable range, depending on the combination of books and articles. The list is intended to establish what will be expected of the student and to prevent confusion over the material to be covered. The list should be finalized at the beginning of the quarter during which the student plans to complete the minor field.</p>
		<p>Completion or evaluation of a minor field takes several forms, depending on the policies of different field groups or individual professors. </p>
				<ol>
				  <li>A one-hour oral examination.</li>
				  <li>A three-hour or twenty-four-hour take-home written exam.</li>
				  <li>An “un-timed” synthetic essay, twenty-five to thirty pages, that
				    organizes the scholarship of the field.</li>
				  <li>Three shorter papers (eight to ten pages) each encompassing a single
				    quarter&#8217;s worth of reading. This option is especially appropriate
				    in cases where the student is working with more than one
				    faculty member on a minor field.</li>
				  <li>Developing a course syllabus in the field.</li>
	    </ol>
				<h5 class="program-overview-subhead-4">B. The Major Field: Oral Qualifying Examination and Candidacy</h5>
				<p>Students are normally expected to take their qualifying examination no later than the spring of their third year of study (except as otherwise specified by the individual fields), and required to do so within four years. Students must fulfill all course work, minor field, and language requirements before taking the qualifying examination. The qualifying examination is an oral test in the student&#8217;s major field of study, conducted by at least five examiners. A minimum of three examiners must be members of the Department of History, and usually they will be in the student&#8217;s major field. The fourth can be either a faculty member from inside the department but outside the major field, or someone from another department. The fifth must be a tenured faculty member in another department. The student&#8217;s minor field adviser(s), whether inside the department or in another department, often serve in this “outside” capacity on the orals committee, although this is not required. Students should consult with their adviser about the composition of the examining committee well before their examination. In addition, the membership of the committee must be approved before the exam by the department chair and the dean of Graduate Studies. The student must meet with the graduate coordinator at least three weeks prior to the orals date to arrange for the submission of this paperwork.</p>
				<p>The purpose of the major field oral examination is twofold: 1) to evaluate the student&#8217;s knowledge of the major research field and 2) to discuss the student&#8217;s dissertation project (with the exception of the US field, which holds a separate meeting for this purpose, no later than two months after the exam).</p>
		<p>The exam lasts between two and three hours, and is structured to give each of the five committee members an opportunity to ask questions of the student, based on the major field reading list. When the prospectus is also under discussion, usually the last half-hour is reserved for this purpose. When the exam is over, the student leaves the room and the committee decides whether the student has passed the exam and advanced to candidacy.</p>
                <ol class="upper-alpha">
                  <li> The major field book list should be drawn up by the
                    student in consultation with the faculty adviser and should
                    be finalized at least thirty days before the date of the
                    exam. Each major field list will reflect the unique interests
                    of the student, while also incorporating core themes of the
                    field. Some field groups have formal core lists that may
                    comprise a part of each student&#8217;s total list, while
                    others do not. In all cases, students are expected to organize
                    their major field lists according to the specific themes/nations/issues
                    that have informed their graduate study, since no major field
                    list can be all-inclusive. The number of titles on a major
                    field list should be around 100, with 80–120 titles representing
                    a reasonable range. The date of the examination is determined
                    by consultation between the candidate and the examining committee.</li>
                  <li>The discussion of the dissertation project will be framed
                    by a five- to ten-page prospectus written by the student
                    and submitted to the committee with the book list at least
                    three weeks before the exam. The purpose of the discussion
                    is to determine the feasibility of the scope of the project
                    and to offer suggestions about source materials and research
                    strategies.</li>
                </ol>
				<p>Should a student fail the examination, the examining committee will clarify the weaknesses in the exam, so that the student can prepare to take it a second time. If a second oral examination is warranted, the department requires that it should be taken no later than one quarter after the first examination. If the student fails the oral examination a second time, his or her graduate studies in the department will be terminated.</p>
				<p>An MA may also be awarded to continuing doctoral students upon successfully passing the oral qualifying examination. The MA is not automatically awarded; students must apply in advance to receive the degree, but no additional work is required. <b>Note:</b> Students who wish to receive an MA as part of the doctoral program must apply for master&#8217;s degree candidacy by the end of the second week of the quarter in which they expect to receive the degree. Please see the graduate coordinator regarding this application.</p>
				<p>The various requirements noted above apply to students who have done no previous graduate work in history. If a candidate has completed some graduate work before entering UC San Diego, appropriate adjustments in course work may be approved by general petition to the graduate committee. Nevertheless, all candidates are required to meet language requirements, pass field examinations, and complete and defend a dissertation.</p>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Dissertation </h4>
				<p>After completing all relevant examinations and language requirements,
				  the student is expected to write a dissertation under the supervision of
				  his or her faculty adviser and the doctoral committee. The Department of
				  History has established the following guidelines for dissertation work.
				  The dissertation should</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="list-level-1">represent an original and significant contribution to knowledge.</li>
					<li class="list-level-1">be based upon primary research.</li>
					<li class="list-level-1">clearly demonstrate the capacity of the student to pursue independent historical research.</li>
					<li class="list-level-1">be written in clear and coherent prose.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The scope of the dissertation and its length will depend upon the nature of the problem and the documentation. The department encourages students to complete their research and writing by the end of their sixth year of study. The scope and length of the dissertation should therefore be such that a complete project can be executed in no more than three years, but it should also be capable of further development for publication as a series of articles in scholarly journals, or as a book. </p>

</table>
 
    <h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Departmental PhD Time Limit Policies </h4>
				<p>Students must be advanced to candidacy by the end of four years. Total university support cannot exceed seven years. Total registered time at UC San Diego cannot exceed eight years. </p>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Financial Support </h4>
				<p>Upon recommendation of the department, several types of financial aid are available to graduate students: teaching assistantships, readerships, research assistantships, fellowships, and travel grants, and full or partial remission of fees and tuition. Graduate students are eligible for one or a combination of the six forms of financial support.</p>
				<p>Entering students who are offered a multi-year financial package are either offered fellowships or readerships, along with fee and tuition remission during their first year, followed by guaranteed employment as a teaching assistant in subsequent years. In some cases, guaranteed dissertation writing funds are part of such a package. Regardless of the initial financial package, the department seeks to ensure that all continuing doctoral students are financially supported, usually through TAships. In recent years all students needing support have received either fellowships, teaching assistant, or research assistant positions. To the extent that resources are insufficient to meet the need, the department, on the advice of the graduate committee, will rank students using a combined criterion of academic performance and financial need.</p>
				<p>Fellowships, travel grants, and research assistantships are granted by the Office of Graduate Studies (OGS) upon the recommendation of the department. Teaching assistants are appointed by the department upon the recommendation of the graduate committee and by the college writing programs. Readers are appointed by the department upon the recommendation of the professor whose course requires such assistance. At the discretion of the department, half-time graduate students are eligible for 25 percent TAships. Graduate students must maintain a minimum grade point average of 3.0 to be considered for any type of financial aid. Financial support is not renewed automatically but is approved by the department on a yearly basis. </p>
				<p>Departmental policy has been to seek seven years of support for students in the program. The Office of Graduate Studies grants partial remission of fees for nine quarters after advancement to candidacy (“normative time”) if the student is advanced to candidacy by the end of the third year. (If the student delays advancement, the amount of normative time is reduced accordingly.) Upon expiration of normative time the student must complete the dissertation or resume full payment of fees.</p>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Opportunities for Teaching </h4>
				<p>Undergraduate teaching, for which graduate teaching assistants earn regular academic credit, is an integral part of the graduate program at UC San Diego. The department considers experience in teaching an important part of a graduate student&#8217;s professional training. To prepare for an academic career, the doctoral candidate is encouraged to assist in courses offered by the department, ordinarily as a course Reader (grader) or Teaching Assistant. A maximum of four units per quarter may be taken in undergraduate teaching.</p>
				<p>Readerships are available in a variety of upper-division history courses, while the department offers positions for teaching assistantships in lower-division East Asian and US history courses. Graduate students in other fields usually serve as TAs in the interdisciplinary college programs, such as ERC&#8217;s “Making of the Modern World,” Revelle&#8217;s “Humanities,” Marshall&#8217;s “Dimensions of Culture,” Sixth&#8217;s “CAT,” and the Muir College Writing Program.</p>
				<p>Students must maintain a minimum grade point average of 3.0 in order to receive academic employment on campus.</p>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Job Placement </h4>
				<p>In recent years, 85 percent of the department&#8217;s doctoral graduates received positions as tenure-track assistant professors at colleges and universities around the country. The remaining 15 percent are currently administrators, visiting scholars, lecturers, or postdoctoral fellows at various educational institutions. Experience indicates that many from this latter group will eventually get professional appointments.</p>
        <h4>Specialization in Critical Gender Studies </h4>
				<p>Students in the doctoral program in history may apply for a specialization in critical gender studies to complement their course work and research in history. </p>
				<p>The Critical Gender Studies Program is built on the intellectual foundations of intersectional feminist thought and queer studies, and incorporates the interdisciplinary methodologies, intersectional frameworks, and transformational epistemologies central to contemporary gender and sexuality studies. The graduate specialization in critical gender studies provides specialized training in gender and sexuality for students currently enrolled in a UC San Diego doctoral program. Through advanced course work in critical gender studies and its affiliated departments,&nbsp;graduate students in the specialization develop an understanding of gender as necessarily linked to other social formations, including sexuality, race, nation, religion, (dis)ability, and structures of capital.&nbsp;At the same time,&nbsp;doctoral&nbsp;students engaging&nbsp;gender and sexuality studies&nbsp;have the opportunity to develop their work among peers who take up similar questions in their scholarship.</p>
				<p>Admitted students are required to complete five courses in addition to their home department&rsquo;s core requirements, consisting of two core courses and three electives. The core courses are Advanced Studies in Critical Gender Studies (CGS 200), to be taken shortly after admission to the specialization, and Practicum in Critical Gender Studies (CGS 299), to be taken in the student&rsquo;s final two years of dissertation writing. Electives may be chosen from a list of preapproved seminars in participating departments (students may petition other courses with significant gender/sexuality studies content) and may be taken at any time during the student&rsquo;s tenure at UC San Diego. Admitted students must also include at least one member of their dissertation committee from the list of CGS core or affiliate faculty.</p>
