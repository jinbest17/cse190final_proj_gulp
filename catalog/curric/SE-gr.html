 <p>The Department of Structural Engineering offers programs leading to the degrees of master of science (MS) and doctor of philosophy (PhD) in structural engineering (SE). In addition, an MS in structural engineering with specialization in structural health monitoring and nondestructive evaluation (MS SHM&amp;NDE) is offered. The graduate program is aimed at training a select number of highly skilled professionals in structural engineering with the academic and engineering credentials to assume leadership roles in industry and academia. </p>
<p>The MS program is intended to provide students with additional fundamental knowledge as well as specialized advanced knowledge in selected structural engineering aspects over and above the undergraduate degree course work. </p>
				<p>The doctor of philosophy (PhD) degree program is intended to prepare students for careers in teaching, research, or practice in their chosen professional specialties. The PhD program requires a departmental comprehensive examination, a PhD candidacy examination, a PhD dissertation based on new and unique research, and a dissertation defense. </p>
				<p>Both degrees offer opportunities for training in one or more of the six primary research focus areas within the SE department: (1) Civil Structures, (2) Advanced Composites and Aerospace Structural Systems, (3) Geotechnical Engineering, (4) Structural Health Monitoring, Prognosis, and Validated Simulations, (5) Mechanics and Materials, and (6) Computational Mechanics. </p>
<p>Admission to the UC San Diego graduate program in structural engineering
				  requires at least a BS in engineering, physical sciences,
				  or mathematics with an overall upper-division GPA of 3.0. Applicants
				  must provide three letters of recommendation and recent GRE
				  general test scores. International applicants whose native
				  language is not English are required to demonstrate proficiency
				  in English by taking the TOEFL test. The minimum TOEFL score
				  required is 550 (paper-based) and 80
				  (internet-based text [iBt]). Based on the candidate&#8217;s choice,
				  qualifications, and career objectives, admission to the program
				  is in one of two categories: MS or PhD. </p>
				<p>Applicants seeking enrollment in SE courses via UC Extension&#8217;s concurrent
				  registration program are advised to refer to the<em> “</em><a href="../front/GradAdmission.html#transcredit">Graduate
				  Studies Transferring Credit</a><em>”</em> section of the<em> UC San Diego General Catalog</em> for clarification. </p>
				<h2>Bachelor’s/Master’s Program </h2>
                <p>The department offers a bachelor’s/master’s program
                  to enable students to complete both the BS and MS 
                  in an accelerated timeframe. Undergraduate students in the
                  Department of Structural Engineering who have at least 148
                  quarter units with a cumulative GPA of 3.5 or higher are eligible
                  to apply. Admission to the bachelor’s/master’s degree program
                  is not automatic. Student applications are reviewed and the
                  final decision is made by the Department of Structural Engineering.
                  Acceptance into this program is an honor that carries with
                  it practical benefits—the graduate application process is simplified
                  (no GREs required) and advanced students are given access to
                  graduate level courses. Upon acceptance as an undergraduate
                  into the program, a faculty member will be assigned who will
                  serve as the student’s adviser. Interested students should
                  contact the Structural Engineering Student Affairs Office.
                  Students must fulfill all requirements for the BS 
                  prior to being formally admitted to graduate status.		</p>
        <h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">Master&#8217;s Degree Program </h2>
				<p>The MS program is intended to provide the student with additional
				  fundamental knowledge as well as specialized advanced knowledge in selected
				  structural engineering aspects over and above the undergraduate degree
				  course work. Two plans, the MS thesis plan and the MS comprehensive
				  examination plan, are offered. The MS thesis plan is designed for those
				  students with an interest in research prior to entering the structural
				  engineering profession or prior to entering a doctoral degree program.
				  The MS thesis plan involves course work leading to the completion and
				  defense of a master’s thesis. The MS comprehensive examination plan involves
				  course work and requires the completion of a written comprehensive examination
				  covering multiple courses that the student has taken. The MS comprehensive
				  examination will be comprehensive and cover two focus sequences and at
				  least one additional technical elective that the student has taken. The
				  examination must be completed no later than the end of the eighth week
			    of the quarter the student intends to graduate.                </p>
				<p>MS students will be required to complete two out of seven core course electives. The courses are SE 200, SE 201A, SE 202, SE 203, SE 241, SE 271, and SE 233 (or SE 276A). They can be counted toward a focus sequence or a technical elective.</p>
<p>MS students must complete forty-eight units of credit for graduation. For the MS comprehensive examination plan all forty-eight units of credit must consist of regular courses (twelve courses). For the MS thesis plan, thirty-six units (nine courses) from regular courses are required, in addition to twelve units of graduate research for the master&#8217;s thesis. For both MS plans, students are required to complete a minimum of two sequences from the following focus areas: </p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Structural Analysis </li>
				  <li>Structural Design  </li>
				  <li>Computational Mechanics and Finite Elements</li>
				  <li>Earthquake Engineering </li>
				  <li>Geotechnical Engineering</li>
				  <li>Aerospace and Advanced  Composites </li>
				  <li> Solid Mechanics</li>
			      <li>Structural Health Monitoring </li>
		
                </ol>
<p>A sequence is composed of three regular courses from the same focus area. The courses comprising the focus sequences are listed in the table in this section. To meet the specific needs of some students, other focus areas may be developed by a student in consultation with his or her adviser, but these must be preapproved by the SE Graduate Affairs Committee. To allow for greater flexibility in the program, the remaining credits required from courses may be earned by completing additional focus sequences, parts of focus sequences, or other appropriate courses. Students may elect to take other appropriate technical electives (with the approval of their adviser and the SE Graduate Affairs Committee). In special cases where an undergraduate course may be used, the arrangement must be preapproved by both the academic adviser and the Graduate Affairs Committee. Units obtained in SE 290 and 298 may not be applied toward course work requirements. No more than four units of SE 296 may be applied toward course work requirements and only with prior approval of the SE Graduate Affairs Committee. </p>
<p>The department also offers a seminar course each quarter dealing with current research topics in structural engineering (SE 290). Students must take SE 290 every quarter in the first year and are strongly recommended to take it for at least one quarter in every subsequent year.</p>

		<p>The thesis defense is the final examination for students enrolled in the MS thesis plan and must be conducted after completion of all course work. Upon completion of the research project, the student writes a thesis that must be successfully defended in an oral examination and public presentation conducted by a committee composed of three faculty members. A complete copy of the student&#8217;s thesis must be submitted to each member of the MS thesis committee (comprised of a minimum of three faculty) at least two weeks before the defense. </p>
				<h2>MS in Structural Engineering with Specialization in Health Monitoring and Nondestructive Evaluation (SHM&amp;NDE)</h2>
                <p>The master of science in structural engineering with specialization in structural health monitoring and nondestructive evaluation (SHM&amp;NDE) provides highly interdisciplinary knowledge incorporating three broad technology areas: (1) sensing technology, (2) data interrogation, and (3) modeling and analysis. The intersections and integration of these technology areas are fundamental to supporting structural health monitoring and nondestructive evaluation, which may be defined as the process of making an uncertainty-quantified assessment, based on appropriate analyses of in-situ measured data, about the current ability of a structural component or system to perform its intended design function(s) successfully. This discipline within structural, civil, mechanical, and aerospace engineering is a fundamental capability that supports &ldquo;design-to-retirement&rdquo; life cycle management of systems.                </p>
                <p>Two degree options in SHM&amp;NDE will be offered: MS thesis option and MS comprehensive examination option. Students in both plans must complete thirty-six units of credit for graduation. For both options, students must complete two core courses, SE 263, Nondestructive Evaluation, and SE 265, Structural Health Monitoring Principles (eight total units). Additionally, the MS SHM&amp;NDE thesis plan involves regular course work (twenty units) and graduate research (eight units) leading to the completion and defense of a master&rsquo;s thesis. Correspondingly, the MS comprehensive examination plan involves regular course work (twenty-four units) and a mentored independent study (SE 296) capstone course. The comparative distribution of units for each of the two degree options is shown in the table below:</p>

                <p>For the MS thesis option, the eight-unit graduate research (SE 299) culminates with the preparation of a written research thesis. The thesis must be successfully defended in an oral examination and public presentation conducted by a committee composed of three faculty members. The committee will consist of three faculty members, one with expertise in each of the three focus areas. A complete copy of the student&rsquo;s thesis must be submitted to each member of the MS thesis committee at least two weeks prior to the defense.                </p>
                <p>For the MS comprehensive option, the four-unit independent study (SE 296) must be conducted as a capstone experience project. This project is intended to provide a mentored project whereby students integrate knowledge learned from their technology areas into solving a problem from structural health monitoring/prognosis or nondestructive evaluation. The specific deliverables associated with the capstone project experience will be proposed by the student together with the SE 296 mentor and will be approved by the director of the MS program by the end of the quarter preceding the one in which the student intends to register in SE 296. The deliverables will be delivered to the SE 296 mentor, assessed by the mentor, and both the deliverables and assessment will be submitted to the director of the MS program for final approval. </p>
                <p>Because of the inherent interdisciplinary nature of the MS SHM&amp;NDE program, research within SE 296 or SE 299 may be conducted at outside locations (industry or government facilities). In this case a scientist or engineer on location, with an adjunct faculty appointment at UC San Diego, will be identified as the SE 296 mentor or the SE 299 adviser and who will also be a member of the thesis committee.</p>
                <p>All students in this degree program, for both degree options, must register in SE 290, Seminar, for any two quarters while enrolled in the program.</p>
                <h2>MS in Geotechnical Engineering</h2>
                <p>The MS program is intended to provide students with additional fundamental knowledge as well as specialized advanced knowledge in geotechnical engineering over and above that available in the BS in structural engineering at UC San Diego (SE 181, SE 182, and SE 184). Students seeking to pursue the MS program in geotechnical engineering should have an undergraduate degree in structural or civil engineering. Further, students are required to take SE 181 and SE 182, or their equivalents at another university, as a prerequisite to pursuing the MS degree in geotechnical engineering. Exceptions to this will not be granted, though SE 182 may be taken concurrently with other MS course work with instructor and adviser approval. </p>
                <p>The MS program includes required core courses and technical elective courses. MS students must complete forty-eight units of graduate course credit for graduation (twelve courses). Students must obtain approval from their adviser and the SE Graduate Affairs Committee on proposed course work to complete the degree. Although there are no foreign language requirements with the MS program in geotechnical engineering, CCGA recognizes that foreign language competence may be an important element of graduate education of doctoral programs. Two MS plans are offered—the MS comprehensive examination plan and the MS thesis plan. All MS students will be assigned an adviser upon entering the MS program who can provide guidance on selecting between these plans. Students may switch advisers after the first quarter. Students must choose between the MS comprehensive examination plan and the MS thesis plan by the end of the second quarter of study.</p>
        <p>The MS comprehensive examination plan requires forty-eight units (twelve courses) of regular course work and completion of a written comprehensive examination covering the course work. The comprehensive examination must be taken no later than the end of the eighth week of the quarter for which the student intends to graduate. The comprehensive examination will be prepared and assessed by the student&rsquo;s adviser and may include an examination on topics related to the selected course work or a written report on a subject that integrates two or more of the courses in the program. In addition to the forty-eight units, students must take SE 290 every quarter in the first year for the MS comprehensive examination plan and are strongly recommended to take it for at least one quarter in the subsequent year. The MS thesis plan is designed for students with an interest in research prior to entering a professional career or a doctoral degree program. For this plan, thirty-six units (nine courses) of regular course work are required, along with twelve units of graduate research (SE 299) for work on an MS thesis. The thesis defense is the final examination for students enrolled in the MS thesis plan and must be taken no later than the end of the eighth week of the quarter for which the student intends to graduate. The thesis must be defended in a public presentation with an oral examination conducted by a committee composed of three faculty members. A complete copy of the thesis must be submitted to the committee at least two weeks prior to the defense. In addition to the forty-eight units, students must take SE 290 every quarter in the first year for the MS thesis plan and are strongly recommended to take it for at least one quarter in the subsequent year.</p>

        <h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">Doctoral Degree Program </h2>
				<p>The PhD program is intended to prepare students for a variety of careers in research, teaching and advanced professional practice in the broad sense of structural engineering, encompassing civil and aerospace structures, earthquake and geotechnical engineering, composites, and engineering mechanics. Depending on the student&rsquo;s background and ability, research is initiated as soon as possible. All students, in consultation with their advisers, develop course programs that will prepare them for the departmental comprehensive examination and for their dissertation research. However, these programs of study and research must be planned to meet the time limits established to advance to candidacy and to complete the requirements for the degree. Doctoral students who have passed the departmental comprehensive examination may take any course for an S/U grade, with the exception of any course that the student&rsquo;s departmental comprehensive or PhD candidacy examination committee stipulates must be taken in order to remove a deficiency. It is strongly recommended that all structural engineering graduate students take a minimum of two courses (other than research) per academic year after passing the departmental comprehensive examination. </p>
<p>The department also offers a seminar course each quarter dealing with current research topics in structural engineering (SE 290). Students must take SE 290 every quarter in the first year of graduate study if they are planning to obtain an MS degree, and it is strongly recommended to take it for at least one quarter in every subsequent year.</p>
<p>All doctoral students will be required to take SE 200, Applied Mathematics in Structural Engineering, prior to taking the departmental comprehensive exam.</p>
				<p><strong>Doctoral examinations: </strong>A structural engineering PhD student is required to pass three examinations. The first is a <strong>departmental comprehensive examination </strong>that should be taken within three to six quarters of full-time graduate study and requires a 3.5 GPA. This examination is intended to determine the student&rsquo;s ability to successfully pursue a research project at a level appropriate for the doctoral degree. It is administered by at least four faculty, three of whom must be in structural engineering. The student is responsible for material pertaining to four focus areas. One focus area can be satisfied by course work, provided that all courses in that area have been taken at UC San Diego, the grade in each course is B or better, and the overall GPA in that area is at least 3.5. In order to insure appropriate breadth, the focus areas should consist of the following: (a) two focus areas within structural engineering which are closely related to the student&rsquo;s research interests, (b) one focus area within structural engineering that is not directly related to the student&rsquo;s area of research, and (c) one minor focus area outside the Department of Structural Engineering. An update list of sample focus areas for PhD students is available in the structural engineering Graduate Handbook. Minor areas too closely related to the major areas will not be approved by the SE Graduate Affairs Committee. The Solid Mechanics Focus Sequence, which is jointly taught by the Department of Structural Engineering and the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, cannot be used to satisfy the outside structural engineering requirement. Students intending to specialize in the emerging areas of structural health monitoring, damage prognosis, and validated simulations are advised to take courses in the focus areas of structural health monitoring and elective courses MAE 283, MAE 261, ECE 251AN, ECE 251BN, ECE 254, and CSE 291, which can be used to satisfy the outside structural engineering requirement. </p>
<p>Since the examination areas must be approved by the Structural Engineering Graduate Affairs Committee, students are advised to seek such approval well before their expected examination date, preferably while planning their graduate studies. Although students are not required to take particular courses in preparation for the departmental comprehensive examination, the scope of the examination in each area is associated with a set of three graduate courses, generally in focus areas offered or approved by the department. A list of focus areas is available in the <em>Structural Engineering Graduate Handbook</em>. A candidate can develop a sense of the level of knowledge expected to be demonstrated during the examination by studying the appropriate syllabi and/or discussing the course content with faculty experienced in teaching the courses involved. The departmental comprehensive examination may be a written or an oral examination, at the discretion of the committee. </p>
<p><strong>Teaching experience</strong> is required of all structural engineering PhD students prior to taking the PhD candidacy examination. Teaching experience is defined as lecturing one hour per week in either a problem-solving section or laboratory session, for one quarter in an undergraduate course designated by the department. The requirement can be fulfilled by serving as a teaching assistant or by taking SE 501 for academic credit. Students must contact the Student Affairs Office to plan for completion of this requirement. </p>
<p>The <strong>PhD candidacy examination</strong> is the second examination required of structural engineering doctoral students. In preparation for the PhD candidacy examination, students must have completed the departmental comprehensive examination and the departmental teaching experience requirement, obtained a faculty research adviser, have identified a topic for their dissertation research, and have made initial progress in that research. At the time of application for advancement to candidacy, a doctoral committee responsible for the remainder of the student&rsquo;s graduate program is appointed by the Graduate Council. In accordance with Academic Senate Regulations 715(D): &ldquo;A doctoral committee of five or more members shall be appointed by the dean of Graduate Studies under the authority of the Graduate Council. The committee members shall be chosen from at least two departments, and at least two members shall represent academic specialties that differ from the student&rsquo;s chosen specialty. In all cases, each committee must include one tenured UC San Diego faculty member from outside the student&rsquo;s major department.&rdquo; The committee conducts the PhD candidacy examination, during which students must demonstrate the ability to engage in dissertation research. This involves the presentation of a plan for the dissertation research project. A short, written document describing the research plan must be submitted to each member of the committee at least two weeks before the PhD candidacy examination. The committee may ask questions directly or indirectly related to the research project and general questions that it determines to be relevant. Upon successful completion of this examination, students are advanced to candidacy and are awarded the candidate of philosophy degree. The PhD candidacy examination is an oral examination.</p>
<p><strong class="myriad-pro-semibold">The dissertation defense</strong> is the final PhD examination. Upon completion of the dissertation research project, the student writes a dissertation that must then be successfully defended in an oral examination and public presentation conducted by the doctoral committee. A complete copy of the student&#8217;s dissertation must be submitted to each member of the doctoral committee at least four weeks before the defense. While the copy of the dissertation handed to the committee is expected to be complete and in final form, it should be noted that students are expected to make changes in the text per direction of the committee as a result of the defense. This examination cannot be conducted earlier than three quarters after the date of advancement to doctoral candidacy. Acceptance of the dissertation by the Office of Graduate Studies and the university librarian represents the final step in completion of all requirements for the PhD. </p>
				<p><strong class="myriad-pro-semibold">PhD time limit policy. </strong>Precandidacy status is limited to four years. Doctoral students are eligible for university support for six years. The defense and submission of the doctoral dissertation must be within seven years.</p>
				<p><strong class="myriad-pro-semibold">Evaluations.</strong> In the spring of each year, the department faculty members evaluate each doctoral student&#8217;s overall performance in course work, research, and prospects for financial support for future years. A written assessment is given to the student after the evaluation. If a student&#8217;s work is found to be inadequate, the faculty may determine that the student cannot continue in the graduate program.</p>

        Program policies: The following is a list of policies for the PhD specialization with regard to proficiency, qualifying, and elective requirements.</p>
        <ul>
                  <li>Proficiency in computer engineering must be demonstrated by the end of the first year.
                  </li>
                  <li>The qualifying exams must be passed by the end of the second year or, on petition, by end of the third year.</li>
                  <li>The qualifying exams can be attempted repeatedly but no more than once per quarter per subject.</li>
                  <li>The qualifying exams in the home department and the CSME qualifying exams must all be passed before the student is permitted to take the candidacy exam (Senate Exam).</li>
                  <li>Two electives outside the home department must be taken.</li>
                  <li>The two electives can be taken at any time before defending the thesis.</li>
                  <li>One of the electives may be taken Pass/Fail; the other must be taken for a letter grade.<br>
          </ul>
                    <h3>Structural Engineering Seminar</h3>
                    <p>The department offers a biweekly seminar on topics of current interest in structural engineering and on departmental research programs. Students are expected to register and attend the colloquium.</p>
                    <p><em>Students have an option of obtaining credit for a structural engineering graduate course by taking the final examination without participating in any class exercises. They must, however, officially register for the course and notify the instructor and the Department of Structural Engineering graduate affairs office of their intention no later than the first week of the course.</em>
