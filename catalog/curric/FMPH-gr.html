The department has a major education mission and hosts both an undergraduate degree and a doctoral degree in public health. It has a major role in teaching in the School of Medicine curriculum and hosts four separate medical residencies in Family Medicine (two), Family Medicine-Psychiatry, and Preventive Medicine. In addition, the department hosts the self-funding Master of Advanced Studies (MAS) degree in Leadership of Healthcare Organizations. </p>
        <h2>The Doctoral Program in Public Health </h2>
        <p>A PhD in public health with a concentration in epidemiology, health behavior, or global health is offered by the joint faculties of the Graduate School of Public Health at San Diego State University (SDSU) and the Department of Family Medicine and Public Health (FMPH) with assistance from other departments in the School of Medicine at UC San Diego. Currently there are three specializations: <a href= #epidemiology>epidemiology</a>, <a href=#globalhealth>global health</a>, and <a href="#healthbehavior">health behavior</a>.</p>
        <p>For each specialization, the first year in this program involves full-time course work at SDSU with second-year full-time course work at UC San Diego. These two years fulfill the residency requirements for both universities. Students are expected to advance to candidacy in the third year. Applicants who enter with a master&rsquo;s degree s are expected to graduate by the end of the fifth year.</p>

<p class="basic-offset-top-only">Since 2007, a PhD in public health with a concentration in global health has been offered by multidisciplinary faculty in UC San Diego&#8217;s School of Medicine and the Graduate School of Public Health at San Diego State University. Global health relates to health issues and concerns that transcend national borders, class, race, ethnicity, and culture, stresses the commonality of health issues, and calls for collective, partnership-based action to resolve these issues. Accordingly, emphasis is on preparing graduates with the fundamental knowledge, understanding, and specific skills necessary to become public health researchers and professional leaders in global health settings. Proximity to the U.S./Mexico border and expertise of many current faculty support and encourage a focus on infectious diseases (e.g., HIV, TB, STDs) and health of migrant populations, although students are expected to develop other areas of specialization within the global health concentration. These may be content areas, such as chronic/infectious disease surveillance and prevention, environmental health, health policy, and substance abuse, or methodological areas such as quantitative, qualitative, and spatial research methodologies that are applied to address health problems of global health significance. Dr. Steffanie Strathdee (UC San Diego) and Dr. Jenny Quintana (SDSU) direct the program.</p>

		<h4>Program Focus</h4>
		<p>The PhD in biostatistics is an interdepartmental program housed within the Department of Family Medicine and Public Health&rsquo;s Division of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics at the School of Medicine, and in partnership with the main campus Department of Mathematics. The core courses are biostatistics offerings from the Division of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, and statistics offerings within the Department of Mathematics. </p>
		<p>Program years one and two include theoretical and applied classroom work in the core mathematical statistics and biostatistics courses, with additional electives in mathematics and/or computer science. The core courses incorporate classroom projects in theory and data analysis pertinent to biomedical data and introduce literate programming and reproducible research practices. Year two requires a set of biostatistics rotations under the tutorship of a faculty mentor, using example data drawn from collaborative projects in biomedical or public health sciences, each with required oral, written, and web-based presentations. The student will select, by the end of year two, a primary adviser from among participating program faculty. Additional training in the biomedical area of application will occur in years three and four. Throughout, the student will participate in presentations and discussions in a seminar series and journal club.</p>
		<p>The PhD thesis, completed in years three to four and potentially five, will contain an original contribution of quality that would be acceptable for publication in the biostatistics literature, which extends the theory or methodology of biostatistics, or extends biostatistical methods to solve a critical problem in applied disciplines. A terminal master&rsquo;s degree in biostatistical sciences is offered for students who fail to complete the PhD in a timely fashion. Students are eligible to obtain the MS degree under Plan II (Comprehensive Examination) if they pass the PhD written qualifying exam at the MS level and obtained forty-eight units of core courses (including MATH 281A-B-C and FMPH 221–223) with a passing grade.</p>

        <h4>Biostatistics Rotations (FMPH 241)&nbsp;</h4>
        <p>The biostatistics rotations are a singular feature of this PhD program that takes advantage of the extensive involvement of the program faculty in collaborative and interdisciplinary work within the life sciences. Students will complete at least two and up to five quarter-length rotations before advancing to candidacy, each in the form of an interdisciplinary applied data analysis project. They may work in collaboration with any UC San Diego faculty researcher who conducts studies or experiments that generate data in the medical, biological, public health, or pharmacologic sciences, and who will serve as a subject area mentor, under the primary mentorship of any biostatistics or statistics member of the interdepartmental program. Each practicum will last a minimum of ten weeks and will involve the analysis of original data. The student will prepare or substantially contribute to a project report, which will be reviewed and signed off on by the mentor. The rotation may be conducted as part of employment as a graduate student researcher or as part of the dissertation research. A report based on an internship of at least ten weeks duration at a facility, government health office, institute, or company outside of UC San Diego focusing on biological or medical research can also be used to satisfy this requirement.</p>

        <h3>Qualifying Examinations and Dissertation Requirements </h3>
        <h4>PhD Written Qualifying Examination</h4>
        <p>The PhD written qualifying examination has two parts: a statistical theory part, developed and scored by the statistics group within the Department of Mathematics; and a biostatistics part, developed and scored by the Division of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics within the Department of Family Medicine and Public Health. The exam committees in charge may be different for each part of the exam. Whether students pass or fail is determined separately by the exam committees for the statistical theory part and the biostatistics part of the exam. The student must pass both qualifying exams at the PhD-provisional pass level or higher, with one qualifying exam receiving a PhD pass grade. Each exam committee will forward its recommendation to the chair of the Graduate Program Committee, which will be the final arbiter of pass or fail.</p>
        <p>The PhD written qualifying examination will be given at the end of each spring quarter and also at the beginning of each fall quarter. Students in the PhD program must attempt the exam in the spring quarter immediately after they complete both the MATH 281A-B-C and FMPH 221-223 core course series. A well-prepared student will take these exams during the first year of the program. Otherwise, they are expected to take the exams during the second year of the program. Students must pass both qualifying exams by the end of the second year in the program. At least one of the exams must be completed with a provisional PhD pass or better by the end of the first year. Failure to meet the passing requirements (i.e., PhD-provisional pass or better on both qualifying exams with at least one PhD-level pass by the end of the second year) on the qualifying exams after two attempts will result in a recommendation to the dean of the Graduate Division for disqualification of the student in the PhD program and dismissal from the university.</p>
<h4>Scientific Research  Examination</h4>
        <p>Students in the PhD program must also pass a scientific research  examination. This consists of a seminar presentation of a statistical application in a particular area of life sciences. The presentation will be evaluated by an ad hoc committee of three faculty members, including at least one outside (nonstatistician) member with expertise in the area of application. The exam is taken Pass/Fail. The student is allowed two attempts at taking this exam. The student should pass this requirement prior to the end of the third year of study.</p>
        <h4>Advancement to Candidacy</h4>
        <p>It is expected that by the end of the third year (nine quarters), students should have a field of research chosen and a faculty member willing to direct and guide them. A student will advance to candidacy after successfully passing the oral qualifying examination, which deals primarily with the area of research proposed. The student will also have successfully completed at least sixty-eight units of required and elective courses within the program. Required courses will be completed letter grade only.</p>
        <p>Advisers must submit the application for the Qualifying Exam (QE) four weeks prior to the exam date; exams taken before receiving approval from the Graduate Division may be deemed null and void. Students must be registered during the quarters in which they take any portion of their QE. To be eligible for the QE, the student must have:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A &ldquo;B&rdquo; average in all work done in graduate standing</li>
          <li>Satisfied all departmental or group requirements</li>
          <li>Removed all academic deficiencies</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The preparation for the exam will be done by working closely with a faculty mentor (independent study) who is a regular member of the interdepartmental Program in Biostatistics. The exam committee consists of the doctoral committee. The PhD qualifying examination examines a student on the breadth and depth of knowledge expected from the course work taken, and a special research topic approved by the committee. The primary purpose of the QE is to validate that the student is academically qualified to conceptualize a research topic, undertake scholarly research and clearly communicate its results, and successfully produce the dissertation required for a doctoral degree. A forty-five minute presentation given by the student is followed by a question period that covers the special research topic as well as course work in general.</p>
        <p>A student who passes the PhD QE is eligible for advancement to candidacy for the PhD degree.</p>
        <h4>Doctoral Dissertation</h4>
        <p>The doctoral dissertation is an essential part of the PhD program. A topic will be selected by the student, under the advice and guidance of a major professor (thesis adviser) and a dissertation committee chaired by the major professor. At least one member of the committee must be a tenured faculty from outside the biostatistics program; often this will be a member of the biomedical sciences faculty who can provide a motivating problem or data set from an area of application, in collaboration with the major adviser. The dissertation must contain an original contribution of quality that would be acceptable for publication in the biostatistics literature that extends the theory or methodology of biostatistics or extends biostatistical methods to solve a critical problem in applied disciplines.</p>
        <p>The entire dissertation committee will conduct a final oral examination, which will deal primarily with questions arising out of the relationship of the dissertation to the field of biostatistics.<u></u></p>
        <h4>Time Limits</h4>
        <p>The goal of this policy is to encourage PhD completion in a timely manner.</p>
        <p><strong>Precandidacy limit.</strong> Maximum registered time to advance to PhD candidacy: eleven quarters</p>
        <p><strong>Support limit.</strong> Maximum registered time doctoral student is eligible for support: five years</p>
        <p><strong>Total time limit.</strong> Maximum registered time to complete all PhD requirements: six years        </p>

        <h3>Program Focus</h3>
        <p>The MPH program is housed within the Department of Family Medicine and Public Health. Its core courses are offered by various units within this department. </p>
        <p>MPH students will be required to take basic course work in all of the five core public health disciplines (biostatistics; environmental health sciences; epidemiology; health policy and management; social and behavioral sciences), as well as complete a required applied practicum experience. Students need to declare their concentration (epidemiology, general public health, health behavior, or public mental health) by the end of their first year of the program. Required course work credit hours may be reduced for health professionals and students with prior relevant graduate training. The program will require the completion of a thesis or a capstone project. Epidemiology, health behavior, and public mental health (PMH) concentration students, as well as general public health (GPH) concentration students who plan to complete the MPH over two academic years, must choose a capstone faculty mentor or propose a thesis (including forming a thesis committee) by the end of the first quarter of their second year. GPH concentration students who are attempting to complete the MPH in four quarters must choose a capstone faculty mentor or proposal a thesis (including forming a thesis committee) by the end of their third quarter.  </p>
<p>All capstone or thesis requirements should be completed during the students&rsquo; final two quarters.  The capstone is designed to review, integrate, and apply concepts and methods presented in the MPH curriculum and enhance the student&rsquo;s preparation for postgraduation public health practice, research, or education. The capstone project may focus on public health fieldwork or training, a public health practice or program proposal, a report on epidemiology or behavioral science methods, or be based upon the student&rsquo;s practicum experience. In all cases the capstone must be a product demonstrating mastery and synthesis of public health principles consistent with the MPH degree and involve a written report. The thesis option will typically involve analysis and summarization of previously collected data from an ongoing or completed public health research project, although other options, such as newly launched pilot studies or literature reviews, will also be possible. The scope of the thesis will be decided by mutual agreement among the student, thesis adviser, and thesis committee members, and a thesis agreement form will be completed and signed. The thesis must be approved by the student&rsquo;s thesis committee and submitted to UC San Diego&rsquo;s Graduate Division.</p>

        <h3>Capstone Requirement</h3>
        <p>Successful completion of the MPH degree will require a written capstone project. Students will be able to choose from two options for this requirement: completion of a thesis or completion of a written capstone project that focuses on public health practice.</p>
        <h4>Thesis Option</h4>
        <p>Students who select the thesis option for their capstone requirement will be required to form a thesis committee. Per Graduate Division guidelines, the committee must consist of three faculty members, at least two of whom are from the student&rsquo;s major department. The thesis committee chair ideally should have experience in the student&rsquo;s area of research and will serve as the student&rsquo;s primary research mentor. Students are expected to establish their thesis committee by the end of their first year of the program. They should meet with their committee at least once during their first year, and at least once per academic quarter during their second year to discuss their progress and receive guidance.</p>
        <p>After forming a thesis committee, the student will complete a thesis agreement form, outlining the scope of their thesis, which must be signed by their thesis committee members. After determining the scope of their thesis, students will collaborate with their committee to prepare a more detailed thesis proposal, which must be approved by the student&rsquo;s committee before embarking on the thesis project. Thesis projects will typically involve analysis and summarization of previously collected data from an ongoing or completed public health research project, though other types of studies may be approved by the student&rsquo;s thesis committee. The thesis itself must be approved by the student&rsquo;s thesis committee and submitted to UC San Diego&rsquo;s Graduate Division. Students will be encouraged, but not required, to defend their theses in public academic settings.</p>
        <h4>Practice-Oriented Capstone Project</h4>
        <p>Students who choose to complete a practice-oriented capstone project will be asked to review, integrate, and apply concepts and methods from the MPH&rsquo;s curriculum to a practical setting. Many of these projects will build upon the student&rsquo;s practicum field experience. Students will be required to complete an individual written report approved by the practicum coordinator, their faculty academic adviser, and the MPH&rsquo;s graduate committee. A capstone agreement form will be completed and signed prior to the start of the project. All capstone reports will be reviewed by two or more independent faculty reviewers. The report may focus on public health fieldwork or training, a public health practice or program proposal, a report on epidemiology or behavioral science methods, or specific projects related to the student&rsquo;s practicum experience. </p>
        <h4>Time Limits</h4>
        <p>Normative time to degree for the MPH is two years. Students will be allowed a maximum of five years from matriculation to completion of the MPH degree. Students who cannot complete degrees within that time frame may petition for additional time. The program director will decide whether or not to approve these petitions and will act in accordance with UC San Diego policy. </p>
