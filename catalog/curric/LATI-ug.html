				<p>UC San Diego&#8217;s program in Latin American studies has attained national and international distinction for its excellence in teaching, research, and public service. Each year its faculty offers approximately one hundred Latin America-related courses in fourteen academic departments, and the Latin American Studies Program offers three interdisciplinary degrees: </p>
				<ul>
					<li class="list-level-1">Bachelor of arts in Latin American studies</li>
					<li class="list-level-1">Minor in Latin American studies</li>
					<li class="list-level-1">Master of arts in Latin American studies</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Latin American studies at UC San Diego offers distinct advantages: </p>
				<ul>
				    <li>At the      undergraduate level, students may pursue a minor or a BA in Latin American      studies. At the graduate level, students can obtain an MA in Latin      American studies. In addition, various doctoral programs in academic      departments across the social sciences and humanities offer a regional      focus on Latin America. </li>
				
                  <li class="list-level-1">Latin American studies integrates teaching, research, and policy analysis, encouraging students to develop interdisciplinary perspectives and to work actively with faculty on research projects and conferences. </li>
                  <li class="list-level-1">Students participate in the activities of an outstanding array of research and teaching organizations, including the Center for Iberian and Latin American Studies, the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies, the School of Global Policy and Strategy, the Center for Comparative Immigration Studies, and the Institute of the Americas. The Center for Iberian and Latin American Studies (CILAS) sponsors multidisciplinary colloquia, conferences, projects, and publications. CILAS also awards fellowships and grants each year to promising graduate students. </li>
                  <li class="list-level-1">Students are encouraged to interact with visiting Latin American scholars and to participate in Latin America-related internships, seminars, clubs, foreign exchange programs, and other extracurricular activities. </li>
                  <li class="list-level-1">Students at UC San Diego have access to one of the largest and fastest-growing library collections on Latin America in the United States. </li>
                </ul>
				<p>Degree programs in Latin American studies are supervised by an interdisciplinary faculty group under the direction of the director of Latin American studies.</p>
				<h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">The Curricular Program</h2>
				<p class="anchor-parent"><a class="anchor" id="major"></a></p><h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Undergraduate Major in Latin American Studies </h3>
				<p>The bachelor of arts in Latin American studies blends coverage of methodological and theoretical approaches to the study of Latin America with an interdisciplinary formation in the humanities and social sciences. Students receiving this degree will be prepared for employment with government agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and in private sector activities related to Latin America. Many graduates pursue careers in education or go on for more advanced degrees in Latin American studies or other disciplines such as sociology, political science, anthropology, or history. The major also provides a valuable supplement for those interested in subsequent professional degrees in business, law, engineering, medicine, or other fields. </p>
		<p>To satisfactorily complete the BA, students must complete fifty-two credit units taking a broad range of courses from UC San Diego’s humanities and social science departments. All students entering the major must enroll in LATI 50, a lower-division interdisciplinary course that introduces them to Latin America and serves as a foundation for a core sequence of three required upper-division courses focused on Latin American history, society, politics, and culture. A course on special topics (LATI 180), an elective research methods course, and six additional elective courses allow students to acquire research skills and pursue their interests in specific subregions, countries, and areas of study. During their senior year, students in the major are required to take LATI 190, a capstone research seminar in which they write a research paper of seven thousand words in length. As part of the overall requirements, students must demonstrate proficiency in Spanish or Portuguese.</p>
        <p>The requirements for the bachelor of arts in Latin American studies are as follows:
        </p>
        <h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Lower-Division Requirements</h4>
