<p><em>All courses, faculty listings, and curricular and degree requirements described herein are subject to change or deletion without notice. </em></p>
<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p>The Visual Arts Department offers courses in painting, drawing, sculpture, performance, computing in the arts, film, video, photography, and art history/criticism (including that of film and video). A bachelor&rsquo;s degree from this department provides students with a solid liberal arts background and is preparatory training for careers as artists, art historians, filmmakers, video artists, photographers, digital media artists, art critics, and for graduate study in art history and fine arts. It also provides students the initial skills required for teaching and work in museums, television, and the commercial film, photography, and Internet industries. </p>
    <p>The faculty of the Visual Arts Department is composed of actively producing artists and scholars, engaged in research and study concerned with the reconsideration and reevaluation of artistic productions, their information structure, and significance. Consequently, a flexible program of introductory courses has been devised to provide students opportunities to learn about the contexts and practices of significantly different aesthetic and communication structures. A studio course, covering time-based work, as well as drawing, painting, and sculpture, is presented to bring the student into direct contact with the real contingencies compelling redistribution of aesthetic attitudes and reinterpretation of genres. Because of the exploratory nature of our program, the department also emphasizes new media and interdisciplinary practices that would traditionally be considered to have scant relation to the visual arts. These include courses on speculative design, social practice, computing, performance, and theory. In addition to art practice, our curriculum in art history looks at the global context for contemporary art with courses on Chinese; Latin American, including Pre-Columbian; Native American; and Oceanic art, as well as European art from antiquity to the present. </p>
    <p>The administrative offices and undergraduate program of the Visual Arts Department, as well as the offices of the doctoral students in art history, are located in the Mandeville Center for the Arts. Faculty offices and graduate student studios are housed in the Visual Arts Facility sited in Sixth College, and there are additional facilities for visual arts students in the Structural and Materials Engineering Building, including EnVision—the arts and engineering maker studio. Facilities and equipment are available to undergraduates in both the Mandeville Center and at the campuswide Media Center, providing the opportunity to study painting, drawing, photography, computing in the arts, 16mm film, performance, sculpture, and video. Facilities at the Media Center include portable video recording equipment, video and audio editing suites, nonlinear editing, and production studios. Additional film equipment available includes an animation stand, optical printer, two sound-mixing studios, and numerous film editing suites. Courses in computing in the arts take place in labs located at the Visual Arts Facility and the Mandeville Center.</p>
    <p>The department also provides students with the opportunity to view, curate, and exhibit art in campus galleries. The University Art Gallery in Mandeville and the Visual Arts Gallery in SME brings to campus new, cutting-edge art by emerging and established artists, and also houses a curated exhibition of art by graduating undergraduate majors in the spring. The Mandeville Adam D. Kamil Gallery, located on the lower level, is directed by visual arts undergraduate students. A gallery and performance space, located in the Visual Arts Facility, are directed by graduate students. </p>
<p class="anchor-parent"><a class="anchor" id="ugrad"></a></p><h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">The Undergraduate Program </h2>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">College Requirements </h3>
				<p>The Department of Visual Arts teaches courses applicable toward general-education requirements for each college. Optional minors may be taken within any college. </p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Minor in Visual Arts </h3>
				<p>The Department of Visual Arts offers minors in seven areas of study: studio painting/drawing/ sculpture, photography, speculative design, art history, history and criticism of film and video, digital video and film production, and ICAM. A minor consists of seven or eight specific courses, of which at least five must be upper division. No more than two upper-division courses may be taken outside of UC San Diego. Because the requirements differ for each minor, prospective visual arts minors should consult with the departmental adviser for a complete list of appropriate classes acceptable for the minor. </p>
<p>Students are advised to begin their program in the second year; otherwise, they cannot be guaranteed enough time to complete the classes required for a minor. </p>

<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Education Abroad Program </h3>
				<p>Students are often able to participate in the UC Education Abroad Program (EAP) and UC San Diego’s Opportunities Abroad Program (OAP) while still making progress toward completing their major. Financial aid is applicable to study abroad and special study abroad scholarships are readily available. Students considering this option should discuss their plans with an Education Abroad adviser before going abroad, and courses taken abroad must be approved upon return by the departmental faculty adviser. More information on EAP/OAP is detailed in the <a href="EAP.html">Education Abroad Program</a> section of the <em>UC San Diego General Catalog</em> or on the website <a href="http://studyabroad.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">http://studyabroad.ucsd.edu/</a>. Interested students should contact the Study Abroad UC San Diego office in the Matthews Quad Building. </p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Residency Requirements </h3>
				<p>A minimum of two-thirds of the course work completed for the major must be taken at UC San Diego. Students who transfer to UC San Diego in their second or third year may petition to substitute courses taken at other colleges and universities for major requirements.				</p>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Honors Programs </h3>
				<p>The department offers honors programs in art history, in media, and in studio for outstanding students. </p>
				<p>The <strong class="myriad-pro-semibold">art history</strong> honors program will provide outstanding students with preprofessional experience. It consists of an issue-oriented seminar followed by a directed group study and will result in an exhibition with catalogue, a scholarly conference with a mock publication and/or series of research papers. Students who meet the criteria may, with permission of the art history faculty adviser or the art history honors seminar instructor, enroll in the art history honors program during the last quarter of their junior year or as a senior. This program is open to juniors and seniors who meet eligibility requirements: minimum major GPA of 3.5 (3.3 overall), completion of all lower-division art history requirements, completion of all upper-division art history distribution requirements, and completion of Art Historical Methods (VIS 112) and at least one additional art history seminar. The level of distinction will be determined by the faculty committee on the basis of work in the honors seminar and on the research project. </p>
				<p>The<strong class="myriad-pro-semibold"> media</strong> honors program will help students develop high-quality professional portfolios. The honors thesis project is a sequence of individual studies that runs the length of an academic year to provide sufficient time for ideas to develop and critically aware work to be produced. Students may arrange to work with different faculty advisers each term or may engage a single adviser for the year. To be eligible for the honors thesis sequence, students must have at least a 3.5 GPA in the major and have approval of all the advisers with whom they will work. Qualified students may begin their sequence the last quarter of their junior year or during their senior year. At the end of the third quarter, all involved media faculty will meet to critique the overall quality of the final thesis work to determine level of distinction. </p>
				<p>Through exhibition, verbal and written presentations and course work, the <strong>studio </strong>honors program is intended to give the student as strong a technical, critical, and theoretical base as possible. The program is open to juniors and seniors with a minimum 3.5 GPA in the major (3.0 overall), who have completed all lower-division studio requirements and the majority of upper-division requirements. </p>
				<p>Students interested in participating in an honors program should consult
				  with the departmental adviser. </p>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Double Major within the Department </h3>
				<p>There are four double majors within the Department of Visual Arts: art
				  history/theory/criticism paired with either studio, speculative design, media, or ICAM. Students
				  interested in a double major within the department must have at least ten
				  upper-division courses that are unique to each departmental major and the
				  remaining courses may overlap with other major requirements. Students should
			    consult with the departmental adviser for additional information. </p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Major Requirements </h3>
				<p>Twenty courses are required in speculative design, media, and ICAM and eighteen courses in art history and studio for the attainment of the bachelor of arts. A minimum of twelve of these courses must be upper-division, however, some majors may require more upper-division courses. </p>
				<p>All courses taken to satisfy major requirements must be taken for a letter grade, and only grades of C– or better will be accepted in the visual arts major. </p>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Studio Major </h3>
				<p>The studio major is aimed at producing a theoretically based, highly productive group of artists. Lower-division courses are structured to expose students to a variety of ideas in and about the visual arts. Introductory skills are taught, but their development will occur at the upper-division level in conjunction with the student&#8217;s increasing awareness of the range of theoretical possibilities in the field. The curriculum includes courses in drawing, painting, sculpture, performance, photography, digital imaging and electronics, and many offerings in art history/criticism. </p>

                <h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Art History/Theory/Criticism Major </h3>
				<p>The major in art history, theory, and criticism is designed both for students who desire a broadly based education in the humanities and for those who plan to pursue a career in an art-related profession. In both cases, the foundation for study is proficiency in the languages of artistic expression. Through the study of art history, students learn to treat works of art as manifestations of human belief, thought, and experience in Western and non-Western societies from prehistory to the present day. Courses in criticism review the theoretical approaches that are used to understand artistic achievement. By combining art historical and critical study, the program promotes in the student an awareness of the cultural traditions that have shaped his or her intellectual outlook and provides a framework for informed judgment on the crucial issues of meaning and expression in contemporary society. </p>
				<p>Majors are encouraged to take relevant courses in allied disciplines such as history, communication, anthropology, and literature, and in such area programs as classics and Italian studies. In addition, students who plan to apply to graduate schools are strongly advised to develop proficiency in one or more foreign languages, as is dictated by their area of specialization. </p>

				<p>With a visual arts foundation, the program is designed for students who want to become creative videomakers, filmmakers, photographers, and computer artists, encouraging the hybridity of media. The curriculum combines hands-on experience of making with practical and theoretical criticism, provides historical, social, and aesthetic backgrounds for the understanding of modern media, and emphasizes creativity, versatility, and intelligence over technical specializations. It should allow students to go on to more specialized graduate programs in the media arts, to seek careers in film, television, computing, or photography, or to develop as independent artists. All media majors should see the visual arts undergraduate adviser upon entrance into UC San Diego. </p>

        <h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Interdisciplinary Computing and the Arts Major (ICAM) </h3>
				<p>The interdisciplinary computing and the arts major in the Departments of Music and Visual Arts draws upon, and aims to bring together, ideas and paradigms from computer science, art, and cultural theory. It takes for granted that the computer has become a metamedium and that artists working with computers are expected to combine different media forms in their works. All of this makes the program unique among currently existing computer art or design programs which, on the one hand, usually focus on the use of computers for a particular media (for instance, specializing in computer animation, or computer music, or computer design for print) and, on the other hand, do not enter into a serious dialogue with current research in computer science, only teaching the students “off-the-shelf” software. </p>
				<p>The program also recognizes that creating sophisticated artistic works with computers requires a new model of the creative process, one which combines traditional artistic procedures with the experimental research characteristic of the sciences. All in all, it aims to train a new type of cultural producer, who is familiar with art and media history, who is equally proficient with computer programming and artistic skills, who is always ready to learn new technologies, and who is comfortable interacting with scientists and computer industry resources. </p>
				<p>The goals of the program are </p>
				<ul>
					<li class="list-level-1">to prepare the next generation of artists who will be functioning in a computer-mediated culture </li>
					<li class="list-level-1">to give students necessary technical, theoretical, and historical backgrounds so they can contribute to the development of new aesthetics for computer media </li>
					<li class="list-level-1">to prepare students to mediate between the worlds of computer science and technology, the arts, and the culture at large by being equally proficient with computing and cultural concepts </li>
					<li class="list-level-1">to give students sufficient understanding of the trajectories of development in computing so they can anticipate and work with the emerging trends, rather than being locked in particular software currently available on the market </li>
