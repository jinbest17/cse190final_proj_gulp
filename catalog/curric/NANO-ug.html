<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">Departmental Focus </h2>
				<p>The Department of NanoEngineering focuses on nanoscale science, engineering,
				  and technology that have the potential to make valuable advances in different
				  areas that include, to name a few, new materials, biology and medicine,
				  energy conversion, sensors, and environmental remediation. NanoEngineering
				  is a highly diversified and multidisciplinary field. The graduate research
				  programs cover a broad range of topics, but focus particularly on biomedical
				  nanotechnology, nanotechnologies for energy conversion and storage, computational
				  nanotechnology, and molecular and nanomaterials. Undergraduate degree programs
				  focus on integrating the various science and engineering disciplines necessary
			    for successful careers in the evolving nanotechnology industry.				</p>
				<h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">Degree and Program Options </h2>
<p>The Department of NanoEngineering offers two undergraduate programs. One program leads to the BS in NanoEngineering. The other program leads to the BS in chemical engineering. Chemical engineering (BS) is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, <a href="http://www.abet.org" target="_blank">http://www.abet.org</a>. NanoEngineering (BS) is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, <a href="http://www.abet.org" target="_blank">http://www.abet.org</a>. </p>
<p>These two degree programs have very different requirements and are described in separate sections.</p>
<h2>NanoEngineering Program (NANO) </h2>
                <h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Program Mission and Objectives </h3>
                <p>The mission of the NanoEngineering program is to provide a
                  multidisciplinary education in nanoscale science and technology.
                  The primary goals are to ensure that NanoEngineering students will</p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>Have a strong technical background,      enabling them to be successful in careers that cross traditional areas of      applied science and engineering.</li>
                  <li>Be fluent in a multidisciplinary      body of knowledge for participating in and seeding new technologies.</li>
                  <li>Constitute a high-technology      workforce with professional, scientific, and technical skills; they will      conduct themselves ethically and knowledgeably in a wide range of      professional environments.</li>
                </ul>
                
        <h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">The Undergraduate Program </h3>
        <p>The BS program in NanoEngineering is tailored to provide
                  breadth and flexibility by taking advantage of the strength
                  of basic sciences and other engineering disciplines at UC San
                  Diego. The intention is to graduate nanoengineers who are multidisciplinary
                  and can work in a broad spectrum of industries. </p>
        <p>All NanoEngineering courses are taught only once per year, and courses
                  are scheduled to be consistent with the curriculum as shown
                  in the tables below. Under normal circumstances, students must
                  follow the prescribed curriculum. Unavoidable deviation from
                  the curriculum, for example, to participate in the Education
                  Abroad Program, must be approved by the Undergraduate Affairs
                  Committee prior to taking alternative courses elsewhere. Approvals
                  are also needed for engineering courses not listed under the
                  current selections for different engineering focus areas. Courses
                  such as NANO 195, 197, and 198 are not allowed as a NanoEngineering
                  elective in meeting the upper-division major requirements.
                  NANO 199 can be used as a technical elective only under restrictive
                  conditions. Policy regarding these conditions may be obtained
                  from the department’s Student Affairs Office. All students
                  are encouraged to visit the Student Affairs Office or visit
                  the <a href="http://nanoengineering.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Department of NanoEngineering website</a> for any clarification
                  and updated information. To graduate, students must maintain
                  an overall GPA of at least 2.0, and the department requires
                  at least a C– grade in each course required for the major.</p>
        <h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">General-Education/College Requirements</h3>
				<p>For graduation each student must satisfy general-education (GE) course requirements determined by the student&#8217;s college, as well as the major requirements determined by the department. The six colleges at UC San Diego require widely different general-education courses, and the number of such courses differs from one college to another. Each student should choose his or her college carefully, considering the special nature of the college and the breadth of general education.</p>
		<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Major Requirements </h3>
		<p><strong>Basic sciences and mathematics (sixty units):</strong> This
                  lower-division requirement includes twenty-four units of mathematics
                  (MATH 20A-B-C-D-E and MATH 18, formerly MATH 20F), sixteen units of physics (PHYS 2A–D), sixteen
                  units of chemistry (CHEM 6A–C, 7L), and four units of biology
        (BILD 1). </p>
                <p><strong>Engineering preparation (twelve units):</strong> This
                  requirement covers basics in computer programming, circuit

<h3>Admission to NanoEngineering </h3>
<p>Effective fall 2014, NanoEngineering has been granted capped status for freshman applications. Capped status will take effect for continuing and transfer students beginning fall 2015.</p>
<h4>Freshman Admission (effective fall 2014)</h4>
<p>As the NanoEngineering major is capped for incoming freshmen beginning fall 2014, students who have excelled in high school and have declared NanoEngineering on their UC San Diego application are eligible for direct admission into the major.</p>
<p>The UC San Diego Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools will calculate an admissions target number and admit the appropriate number of incoming freshmen into the capped major using the UC San Diego Holistic Review score as a ranking method. Students who meet the UC San Diego admission criteria will be admitted into their chosen capped major, starting with the student having the highest holistic review score, until the admission target number is reached. These students will be notified directly by the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools whether they have been admitted into their chosen capped major. Freshman students who applied but were not admitted directly from high school into the capped NanoEngineering major will be admitted into the major indicated as their second choice on the UC application (providing it is an &ldquo;open&rdquo; major).</p>
<h4>Continuing Freshmen (effective fall 2015)</h4>
<p>Freshmen not directly admitted into the NanoEngineering major will need to apply using the continuing application after their first three quarters (end of spring quarter) or after the end of their sixth quarter (end of spring quarter). A certain number of continuing students who apply will be selected to enter the capped NanoEngineering major.  </p>
<p>Continuing students will be required to complete the following courses <em>prior</em> to applying.</p>
<h5>NANOENGINEERING FRESHMEN APPLICANTS</h5>
<p>(must apply after three quarters): <a href="http://ne.ucsd.edu/undergrad-programs/admissions" target="_blank">http://ne.ucsd.edu/undergrad-programs/admissions</a></p>
<p>Screening courses: MATH 20A, 20B,&nbsp;20C, PHYS 2A, CHEM 6A, 6B, 6C</p>
<h5>NANOENGINEERING SOPHOMORES </h5>
<p>(must apply after six quarters): <a href="http://ne.ucsd.edu/undergrad-programs/admissions" target="_blank">http://ne.ucsd.edu/undergrad-programs/admissions</a></p>
<p>Screening courses: MATH 20A, 20B, 20C, 20D, MATH 18 (formerly MATH 20F),  PHYS 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, CHEM 6A, 6B, 6C, 7</p>
<p>Upon completion of these courses and an online application, students will receive information via email from the Department of NanoEngineering Student Affairs Office. Applications will be ranked according to the GPA obtained in the required courses.</p>
<p>Applications to a capped major will be approved, starting with the student having the highest GPA in the required courses, until the predetermined target number is reached. The Department of NanoEngineering Student Affairs Office will notify students in a timely manner who are successful in transitioning into a capped major to officially declare the appropriate major online via the &ldquo;Major/Minor&rdquo; link under &ldquo;Toolbox&rdquo; at <a href="http://tritonlink.ucsd.edu" target="_blank">http://tritonlink.ucsd.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Continuing students who apply and are unable to transition into a capped major will also be notified of their status in a timely manner by the NanoEngineering Student Affairs Office.</p>
<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Academic Advising</h4>
				<p>Upon admission to the major, students should consult the catalog or NanoEngineering
				  website (<a href="http://nanoengineering.ucsd.edu" target="_blank">http://nanoengineering.ucsd.edu</a>) for their program of study or
				  their undergraduate adviser if they have questions. The program plan may
				  be revised in subsequent years, but revisions involving curricular requirements
				  require approval by the undergraduate adviser or the Undergraduate Affairs
				  Committee. Because some course and/or curricular changes may be made every
				  year, it is imperative that students consult with the department’s undergraduate
			    adviser on an annual basis.</p>
                <p>As aforementioned, NanoEngineering and chemical engineering courses are offered only
                  once a year and therefore should be taken in the recommended
                  sequence. If courses are taken out of sequence, it may not
                  always be possible to enroll in courses as desired or needed.
                  If this occurs, students should seek immediate departmental
                  advice. When a student deviates from the sequence of courses
                  specified for each curriculum in this catalog, it may be impossible
                  to complete the major within the nominal four-year period.</p>
                <p>In addition to the advising available through the Student
                  Affairs Office, programmatic or technical advice may be obtained
                  from faculty members. </p>
<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Program Alterations/Exceptions to Requirements</h4>
				<p>Variations from or exceptions to any program or course requirements are
				  possible only if the Undergraduate Affairs Committee approves a petition
			    before the courses in question are taken. </p>
<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Independent Study</h4>
				<p>Students may take NANO 199, Independent Study for Undergraduates, under the guidance of a NanoEngineering faculty member. This course is taken as an elective on a P/NP basis. Eligible students must have completed at least ninety units and must have a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or better.&nbsp;The two NANO 199s&nbsp;must be done in consecutive quarters and the&nbsp;student must find a faculty member who will oversee the research project. After obtaining the faculty member&rsquo;s concurrence on the topic and scope of the study, the student must submit a&nbsp;<a href="http://ne.ucsd.edu/sites/ne.ucsd.edu/files/docs/Specialstudiesform.pdf" target="_blank">Special Studies Course form</a>&nbsp;(each quarter) and a<a href="http://ne.ucsd.edu/sites/ne.ucsd.edu/files/pdfs/032613_CN_NANO_199Contract_0.pdf" target="_blank">&nbsp;NANO 199 Contract form</a>&nbsp;to the Undergraduate Affairs Committee. These forms must be completed, approved, and processed prior to the add deadline. After the second quarter is completed, the student must submit an Undergraduate Student Petition to have the work accepted as two NanoEngineering&nbsp;elective courses. A final report must be attached to the petition for the faculty member and Undergraduate Affairs Committee to review. Detailed policy in this regard and the requisite forms may be obtained from the Student Affairs Office.</p>
<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Transfer Students </h4>
				<p>The undergraduate engineering curriculum is designed to integrate four years of college educational experience. It will take transfer students three years to complete the major requirements, beyond their junior-college work, for the NanoEngineering Program.&nbsp;Most students need to take MATH 20E (Vector Calculus) at a UC.&nbsp;Transfer students must take NANO 4 and NANO 101 concurrently in their first winter quarter.&nbsp;Students cannot start the junior year of NANO courses until they have taken NANO 101.&nbsp;Students should consult their adviser for a transition program compatible with their junior college preparation.</p>
<p>Requirements for admission as a NanoEngineering major or into NanoEngineering courses
                  are the same for transfer students as they are for continuing
                  students (see section on “<a href="ENG.html#acceptance">Acceptance
                  to Departmental Majors in the Jacobs School of Engineering</a>” in this catalog). Accordingly, when planning their
                  program, transfer students should be mindful of lower-division
                  prerequisite course requirements, as well as for meeting collegiate
                  requirements. </p>
<p>Students who have taken equivalent courses elsewhere may request to have transfer credit apply toward the department&rsquo;s major requirements.

<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><h2>Departmental Focus </h2>
                <p>The Department of NanoEngineering is the administrative home of the interdepartmental Chemical Engineering program (CENG). </p>
                <h2>Undergraduate Program </h2>
                <p>The chemical engineering (BS) program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, <a href="http://www.abet.org" target="_blank">http://www.abet.org</a>. </p>
<h2>Chemical Engineering Program (CENG)</h2>
                <h3>Program Objectives </h3>
                <p>The chemical engineering program has affiliated faculty from the Department of NanoEngineering, Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, and the Department of Bioengineering. The curricula at both the undergraduate and graduate levels are designed to support and foster chemical engineering as a profession that interfaces engineering and all aspects of basic sciences (physics, chemistry, and biology). </p>
                <p>The primary educational objectives of the Chemical Engineering program are to </p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>Provide chemical engineering students with a strong technical education      and communication skills that will enable them to have successful careers      in a wide range of industrial and professional environments. </li>
                  <li>Prepare chemical engineering students for rapidly changing technological      environments with the core knowledge central to multidisciplinary      development and personal improvement throughout their professional      careers. </li>
                  <li>Instill in chemical engineering students a strong sense of humanistic      values and professionalism such that they can conduct ethically and      knowledgeably regarding technological impact in societal issues. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The curriculum is designed to prepare chemical engineering graduates for further education and personal development through their entire professional career. We strive to accomplish these goals by providing a rigorous and demanding curriculum that incorporates lectures, discussions, laboratory and project development experiences in basic sciences, mathematics, engineering sciences, and design as well as the humanities and social sciences. </p>
        <h3>The Undergraduate Program </h3>
                <p>The Chemical Engineering (BS) program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, <a href="http://www.abet.org" target="_blank">http://www.abet.org</a>.  The curriculum is tailored to provide breadth and flexibility by taking advantage of the strength of basic sciences and other engineering disciplines at UC San Diego. The intention is to graduate chemical engineers who are multidisciplinary practitioners and can work in a broad spectrum of industries rather than solely traditional chemical and petrochemical industries. </p>
                <p>Areas of specialization are available whereby a graduate can be in a position for a career in environmental technology, microelectronic device fabrication, materials and polymer processing, pharmaceutical and biotechnology, biomedical engineering, energy and thermal systems, control and system engineering, and so forth. </p>
                <p>For students who aspire to pursue a graduate degree and a career in research and development, the units in an area of specialization can be allocated to more fundamental science and engineering courses. These students are also encouraged to perform independent projects in one of the faculty research laboratories or groups. </p>
                <p>Whether the career goal is industry or graduate or professional school, the curriculum has a strong emphasis on developing problem-solving skills and the ability to think and learn independently. The capstone courses are the senior design and process lab courses. Students learn to participate in project teams, refine their communication skills, and work on various design and experimental projects that, over two quarters, introduce them to elements of project planning, execution, analysis, and improvement.</p>
                <p>Entering freshmen will follow the new set of course work guidelines detailed in this section. Continuing students will continue with their current set of course work guidelines outlined in previous general catalogs. The Student Affairs Office can provide the proper curriculum tables. All students are encouraged to visit the Student Affairs Office or visit the Department of NanoEngineering website for any clarification and updated information.</p>
                <p>Deviations from these programs of study must be approved by the Undergraduate Affairs Committee prior to taking alternative courses. In addition, technical elective (TE) course selections must have departmental approval prior to students’ taking the courses. Courses such as CENG 195, 197, and 198 are not allowed as a technical elective in meeting the upper-division major requirements. CENG 199 can be used as a technical elective only under restrictive conditions. Policy regarding these conditions may be obtained from the department’s Student Affairs Office. To graduate, students must maintain an overall GPA of at least 2.0, and the department requires at least a C– grade in each course required for the major. </p>
                <p>Students with different academic preparation may vary the scheduling of lower-division courses such as math, physics, and chemistry, but should consult the department. Deviations in scheduling chemical engineering upper-division courses are discouraged and require prior approval. Most lower-division courses are offered more than once each year to permit students some flexibility in their program scheduling. However, all chemical engineering upper-division courses are taught only once per year, and courses are scheduled to be consistent with the curricula as shown in the tables. </p>
<h3>General-Education/College Requirements</h3>
                <p>For graduation, each student must satisfy general-education course requirements determined by the student’s college as well as the major requirements determined by the department. The six colleges at UC San Diego require widely different general-education courses, and the number of such courses differs from one college to another. Each student should choose his or her college carefully, considering the special nature of the college and the breadth of general education.</p>
                <h3>Professional Licensing</h3>
                <p>After graduation, all students are encouraged to take the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) examination as the first step in becoming licensed as a professional engineer (PE). Students graduating from our accredited program can take the PE examination after FE certification and two years of work experience; students graduating from a nonaccredited program can take the PE examination after FE certification and four years of work experience.</p>
<p>For further information please contact your local Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors.</p>
                <h3>Major Requirements </h3>
                <p>To receive a BS in chemical engineering, students must complete general-education (GE) requirements of their colleges in the arts, humanities, and social sciences. The balance consists of basic sciences (fifty-four units), chemistry core (twelve units), chemical engineering core (thirty-two units), process laboratory and design (sixteen units), general engineering (twelve units), and an area of specialization (twelve units). Beyond the fifty-three units of basic sciences, the science and engineering courses total to eighty-five units. A one-unit introductory seminar and laboratory course (CENG 4) is required of all incoming freshmen and transfer students. </p>
<p>The specific breakdown is as follows: </p>
<h4>Basic sciences (fifty-four units): </h4>
                <p>This lower-division requirement includes twenty-four units of mathematics (MATH 20A–E and MATH 18, formerly MATH 20F), fourteen units of physics (PHYS 2A–C, 2CL), and sixteen units of chemistry (CHEM 6A–C, 7L). </p>
                <h4>Chemistry core (twelve units): </h4>
                <p><strong>Chemistry Core:</strong> Three advanced chemistry electives must be selected from among CHEM 130, 131, 132, 40A*, 40B*, 114A (or BIBC 100), 114B (or BIBC 102), 120A, 120B, or 43A*. (<strong>Note:</strong> Students may not receive credit for both BIBC 100 and CHEM 114A, or BIBC 102 and CHEM 114B). </p>
                <p>Two recommended options are CHEM 40A, 114A (or BIBC 100), and 43A for those interested in biochemical/organic topics; CHEM 120A, 130, and 40A for those interested in inorganic/materials topics.&nbsp; </p>
                <p>*Effective fall 2017, the following courses were reclassified and renumbered as follows: CHEM 140A is CHEM 40A: Organic Chemistry I (four units), CHEM 140B is CHEM 40B: Organic Chemistry II (four units) and CHEM 143A is CHEM 43A: Organic Chemistry Laboratory (four units). </p>
<h4>Chemical engineering core (thirty-three units): </h4>
                <p>This requirement covers chemical process modeling, solution thermodynamics, transport phenomena, chemical reaction engineering, process control, and unit operations (CENG 4, 100, 101A-C, 102, 113, 120, 122). </p>
                <h4>Process laboratory and design (sixteen units): </h4>
                <p>This requirement is crucial to fulfilling the chemical engineering program (BS) goals by providing hands-on and experiential instruction in the areas of project design, unit operations, hazards analysis, ethics, and economic analysis. (CENG 124A-B, 176A-B). </p>
<h4>General engineering (twelve units): </h4>
                <p>This requirement covers basics in computer programming, probability and statistics, and instrumentation. The computer programming requirement should be satisfied with a course in Matlab (CENG 15). Probability and statistics can be satisfied with CENG 114. Instrumentation is satisfied with MAE 170. </p>
<h4>Electives in an area of specialization (twelve units): </h4>
                <p>Electives are intended to broaden and enhance professional goals. They may be chosen to achieve either breadth or depth in one’s education. All electives must be upper-division courses in engineering. Suggestions are listed below. </p>

<h3>Admission to Chemical Engineering </h3>
<p>Effective fall 2014, chemical engineering has been granted capped status for freshman applications. Capped status will take effect for continuing and transfer students beginning fall 2015.</p>
<h4>Freshman Admission (effective fall 2014)</h4>
<p>As the chemical engineering major is capped for incoming freshmen beginning fall 2014, students who have excelled in high school and have declared chemical engineering on their UC San Diego application are eligible for direct admission into the major.</p>
<p>The UC San Diego Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools will calculate an admissions target number and admit the appropriate number of incoming freshmen into the capped major using the UC San Diego Holistic Review score as a ranking method. Students who meet the UC San Diego admission criteria will be admitted into their chosen capped major, starting with the student having the highest holistic review score, until the admission target number is reached. These students will be notified directly by the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools whether they have been admitted into their chosen capped major.</p>
<p>Freshman students who applied but were not admitted directly from high school into the capped chemical engineering major will be admitted into the major indicated as their second choice on the UC application (providing it is an &ldquo;open&rdquo; major).</p>
<h4>Continuing UC San Diego Students (effective fall 2015)</h4>
<p>Freshmen not directly admitted into the chemical engineering major will need to apply using the continuing application after their first three quarters (end of spring quarter) or after the end of their sixth quarter (end of spring quarter). A certain number of continuing students who apply will be selected to enter the capped chemical engineering major.  </p>
<p>Continuing students will be required to complete the following courses <strong>prior</strong> to applying:</p>
<h5>CHEMICAL ENGINEERING FRESHMEN APPLICANTS</h5>
<p>(must apply after three quarters): <a href="http://ne.ucsd.edu/undergrad-programs/admissions" target="_blank">http://ne.ucsd.edu/undergrad-programs/admissions</a></p>
<p> Screening courses: MATH 20A, 20B,&nbsp;20C, PHYS 2A, 2B, CHEM 6A, 6B, 6C, 7L</p>
<h5>CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SOPHOMORE APPLICANTS</h5>
<p>(must apply after six quarters): <a href="http://ne.ucsd.edu/undergrad-programs/admissions" target="_blank">http://ne.ucsd.edu/undergrad-programs/admissions</a></p>
<p>Screening courses: MATH 20A, 20B, 20C, 20D, MATH 18 (formerly MATH 20F),  PHYS 2A, 2B, 2C, 2CL, CHEM 6A, 6B, 6C, 7L</p>
<h4>Transfer Students </h4>
<p>The chemical engineering curriculum is designed to integrate four years of college educational experience. It is not easy for transfer students to complete the major requirements in only two additional years beyond their junior college work. However, if transfer students seek a college for which they already satisfy the general-education requirements, have taken the lower-division science and mathematics, and have completed some advanced chemistry requirement, then the rigorous first-year schedule below will permit them to graduate in two years. Other students should consult their adviser for a transition program compatible with their junior college preparation. </p>
<p>Requirements for admission as a chemical engineering major into chemical engineering courses are the same for transfer students as they are for continuing students. Accordingly, when planning their program, transfer students should be mindful of lower-division prerequisite course requirements, as well as for meeting collegiate requirements.</p>
<p>Students who have taken equivalent courses elsewhere may request to have transfer credit apply toward the department&rsquo;s major requirements. To receive transfer credit, complete an Undergraduate Student Petition form and submit it to the Student Affairs office. For mathematics, chemistry, and physics, transfer equivalencies are determined by the respective departments. An Undergraduate Student Petition form must be submitted to each department from which the student is requesting transfer credit.</p>
<p>Effective fall 2009, these courses are strongly recommended for all engineering transfer students for success in their major. Community college equivalent courses can be found at <a href="http://assist.org/" target="_blank">http://assist.org.</a></p>

<p>*If you have not completed MATH 20E&nbsp;at the community college, then you may take an advanced chemistry course another quarter.&nbsp;You must complete a petition to take MATH 20E&nbsp;concurrently with&nbsp;CENG&nbsp;101A. Click&nbsp;<a href="http://ne.ucsd.edu/undergrad-programs/degree/advising/student-petitions" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;for more information about petitions.&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Chemical Engineering Transfer Applicants (effective fall 2015)</h5>
<p>Transfer students can apply to switch into the chemical engineering major at the end of their third quarter. Transfer students who are past their third quarter at UC San Diego are not eligible to apply. An online application will be available, and the department will review the applications based on the following criteria (courses taken at UC San Diego) and GPA. <a href="http://ne.ucsd.edu/undergrad-programs/admissions" target="_blank">http://ne.ucsd.edu/undergrad-programs/admissions</a></p>
<p>MATH 20A, 20B, 20C, 20D, MATH 18 (formerly MATH 20F),  PHYS 2A, 2B, 2C, 2CL, CHEM 6A, 6B, 6C, 7L</p>
<p>Upon completion of these courses and online application, students will receive information via email from the Department of NanoEngineering Student Affairs Office. Applications will be ranked according to the GPA obtained in the required courses.</p>
<p>Applications to a capped major will be approved, starting with the student having the highest GPA in the required courses, until the predetermined target number is reached. The Department of NanoEngineering Student Affairs Office will notify students in a timely manner who are successful in transitioning into a capped major to officially declare the appropriate major online via the &ldquo;Major/Minor&rdquo; link under &ldquo;Toolbox&rdquo; at <a href="http://tritonlink.ucsd.edu" target="_blank">http://tritonlink.ucsd.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Continuing students who apply and are unable to transition into a capped major will also be notified of their status in a timely manner by the Department of NanoEngineering Student Affairs Office.</p>
<h4>Academic Advising</h4>
                <p>Upon admission to the major, students should consult the catalog or Department of NanoEngineering website (<a href="http://nanoengineering.ucsd.edu" target="_blank">http://nanoengineering.ucsd.edu</a>) for their program of study or their undergraduate adviser if they have questions. The program plan may be revised in subsequent years, but revisions involving curricular requirements require approval by the undergraduate adviser or the Undergraduate Affairs Committee. Because some course and/or curricular changes may be made every year, it is imperative that students consult with the department’s undergraduate adviser on an annual basis.</p>
                <p>Chemical engineering courses are offered only once a year and therefore should be taken in the recommended sequence. If courses are taken out of sequence, it may not always be possible to enroll in courses as desired or needed. If this occurs, students should seek immediate departmental advice. When a student deviates from the sequence of courses specified for each curriculum in this catalog, it may be impossible to complete a chemical engineering major within the normal four-year period.</p>
                <p>In addition to the advising available through the Student Affairs Office, programmatic or technical advice may be obtained from chemical engineering faculty members. </p>
                <h4>Program Alterations/Exceptions to Requirements</h4>
                <p>Variations from or exceptions to any program or course requirements are possible only if a petition is approved by the Undergraduate Affairs Committee before the courses in question are taken. Petition forms may be obtained from the Student Affairs Office and must be processed through this office.</p>
                <h4>Independent Study</h4>
                <p>Chemical engineering students may take CENG 199, Independent Study for Undergraduates, under the guidance of a chemical engineering faculty member. This course is taken as an elective on a P/NP basis. Eligible students must have completed at least ninety units and must have a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or better. The two CENG 199s must be done in consecutive quarters and the student must find a faculty member who will oversee the research project. After obtaining the faculty member&rsquo;s concurrence on the topic and scope of the study, the student must submit a&nbsp;<a href="https://students.ucsd.edu/_files/registrar/special-studies-form197-198-199_6-13-2014.pdf" target="_blank">Special Studies form</a>&nbsp;(each quarter) and&nbsp;<a href="http://ne.ucsd.edu/sites/ne.ucsd.edu/files/pdfs/032613_CN_CENG_199Contract_0.pdf" target="_blank">CENG&nbsp;199 Contract form</a>&nbsp;to the Undergraduate Affairs Committee. These forms must be completed, approved, and processed prior to the add deadline. After the second quarter is completed, the student must submit an Undergraduate Student Petition to have the work accepted as two technical elective courses. A final report must be attached to the petition for the faculty member and Undergraduate Affairs Committee to review. Detailed policy in this regard and the requisite forms may be obtained from the Student Affairs Office.</p>
        <h4>Program Accreditation </h4>
                <p>The chemical engineering (BS) program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, <a href="http://www.abet.org">http://www.abet.org</a>. </p>
