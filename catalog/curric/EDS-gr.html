        <h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Single Subject Professional Preparation </h4>
				<p>Students engage in an intensive program of professional preparation, including five teaching methods courses in the summer prior to the internship, and seminars offered throughout the academic year that address classroom management techniques and strategies for dealing with individual teaching situations. </p>
				<p>Students admitted to the MEd/Preliminary Single Subject Credential Program are eligible to be interviewed in the summer for a paid internship or student teaching position in a local middle or high school for the following school year. Availability of internship positions is not guaranteed, though EDS attempts to facilitate internship positions for all Single Subject students. Students who do not receive an internship position will do their practicum as student teachers instead. Interns are responsible for teaching classes in their subject area under the guidance of an EDS supervisor and an on-site support-provider. Interns are typically hired as part-time teachers and receive a salary from the school district commensurate with the number of sections taught. </p>

<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">The Master of Arts in Teaching and Learning: Curriculum Design </h3>
<p>The MA in Teaching and Learning (Curriculum Design) offers professional pre-K through postsecondary educators an extensive overview of principles of educational research and curriculum design. </p>
				<p>A key feature of the MA program is the integration of research and practice. MA students remain full-time practitioners for the duration of the program. They design, implement, and evaluate curricular innovations in their own classrooms. The culmination of the MA work is a thesis describing the rationale, development, and effectiveness of these innovations. </p>
				<h5 class="program-overview-subhead-4">Examples of MA Research Projects </h5>
				<p>The topics of the MA theses in past years are varied, and have included: multimedia approaches to secondary biology and chemistry instruction; writing revision among emergent writers; building partnerships between families and schools; activities which link home and school experiences in the content areas of reading and writing, mathematics, science, and social studies; improved integration of curriculum and assessment; motivation and art; using technology for mathematics and geography teaching; and embedding ESL in native-language instruction. </p>
<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">The MA Course of Study (Teaching and Learning: Emphasis in Curriculum Design) </h4>
				<p>The MA program requirements consist of forty quarter units of course work, including the master&#8217;s thesis. Courses are usually offered for four quarter units of credit, and are typically offered one night per week, from 5:00–8:00 p.m. Core course work comprises twenty-eight units, with the remaining twelve units consisting of elective course work. </p>

Official scores from the GRE are also required. <strong>The application deadline is February 1.</strong> The MA in Teaching and Learning: Emphasis in Curriculum Design is not currently accepting applications.</p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">The Master of Arts in Teaching and Learning: Bilingual Education (ASL-English) </h3>
				<p>The Department of Education Studies (EDS) at UC San Diego offers a Master of Arts in Teaching and Learning: Bilingual Education (ASL-English), the California Preliminary Multiple Subject Teaching Credential with a Bilingual Authorization in American Sign Language for elementary school teachers, and the Preliminary Education Specialist: Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Credential. This program of study includes extensive practicum experience combined with the latest research and innovation in bilingual education and deaf education. Students in the program participate in research and development on the leading edge of bilingual, multicultural education for deaf and hard-of-hearing children. </p>
<p>In keeping with its aim of training teachers who will be able to meet the needs of deaf and hard-of-hearing children from various language and cultural backgrounds, EDS requires fluency in ASL for acceptance into the program. EDS&#8217;s teacher training program is designed to prepare teachers to work in various types of school settings from residential school classrooms to local public school classrooms for deaf and hard-of-hearing children. EDS recognizes that deaf and hard-of-hearing children need teachers who are bilingual and knowledgeable about the role of culture in human development. </p>
<h4>Program of Study for the Preliminary Education Specialist: Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Credential, the Preliminary Multiple Subject Teaching Credential, and the Master of Arts in Teaching and Learning: Bilingual Education (ASL-English) </h4>
<p>Students complete a program of study resulting in the California Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Specialist Credential at the elementary level. Students also qualify for the Preliminary Multiple Subject Credential with a Bilingual Authorization in American Sign Language. </p>
<p>This program of study consists of courses in bilingual education theory, methods, and applications to deaf education in addition to intensive classroom practice. During the second year of study the focus is on designing, implementing and evaluating a research-based project. This integration of research and practice is central to the goal of the MA program to develop teachers as researchers. </p>
				<p>The complete program of study includes Professional Preparation course work and the Master of Arts specific course requirements. Both must be complete in order to receive the teaching credentials and the Master of Arts in Teaching and Learning: Bilingual Education (ASL-English). Please see an EDS adviser for a typical course of study, which would include all required courses.</p>

        <h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Education </h3>
                <p>The Department of Education Studies&rsquo; doctorate in education aims to transform education in diverse contexts. The PhD program prepares students to investigate issues of equity in all aspects of the educational process, including equity related to students of color from linguistically and economically diverse communities, as well as other traditionally underserved communities such as those with exceptional physical, emotional, and cognitive development. As we are committed to transforming education in diverse settings, we also need to take an inclusive approach to our definition of diversity. The PhD in education prepares students to be researchers who work with diverse populations, policy-makers, and stakeholders to transform and create more equitable educational opportunities for systemically marginalized students.<br>
                   <br>
                  Students with a PhD in education will have the following skills and knowledge:
         </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>The ability to understand complex educational problems specifically related to equity in educational experiences through interdisciplinary study and collaborative inquiry</li>

                <p>All applications for admission will be reviewed and discussed by the entire PhD faculty. Admissions decisions will be based upon student academic performance, professional and work experience, and the fit between student and faculty interests.  <br>
                   <br>
                  For more detailed and updated information about the admissions criteria and process, see the departmental website.</p>
        <h4>Foreign Language </h4>
                <p>Although we have no foreign language requirement, we expect our students to be familiar with the languages of the linguistically diverse communities in which they will be conducting research and collaborating with school personnel and other members of the community. Specific language requirements for the degree will depend upon the research setting in which a student will be conducting research, and thus this requirement will be determined on a case-by-case basis in consultation with the doctoral committee. Students who need to acquire or improve their linguistic competences prior to conducting research will be referred to language learning resources on campus, such as the Linguistics Language Program, UC San Diego Extension, or other departments on campus, such as history or literature, offering advanced course work in languages.</p>
                <h4>Program of Study </h4>
                <p>Our signature pedagogy is <em>problem immersion:</em> we ask students to read research and learn methodologies in the service of understanding real-world education settings and contexts in underserved communities. In the spirit of design research, graduate students will be embedded in contexts in which they are working closely with individuals who are working toward success with diverse student populations.</p>
                <p>The program has been designed to give doctoral students ample opportunities to conduct research that advances educational change and greater equity for students from racially, economically, and socially marginalized communities. Students will work closely with their faculty adviser and other program faculty members to learn how to cultivate relationships with research participants and to understand the complexities of research in underserved communities, which function under particular histories of access to education and social, economic, and political contexts. Given the histories of different contexts, the communities are defined by cultural, social, political, geographic, and virtual and economic ties.<br>
                   <br>
                  During the first two years of the program, students will take required courses in foundational areas and in rigorous research methods, as well as elective courses. Students will also participate in ongoing Research Apprenticeship Courses (RAC) in which students are immersed in faculty research and faculty support students&rsquo; development as researchers. The apprenticeship course, led by EDS faculty conducting research and/or engaging in practice in the field of education, grounds students in problem-based research from the beginning of their doctoral program.<br>
                   <br>
                  With faculty guidance, students will choose their particular area of focus and select elective courses in education and in other departments accordingly. Ideally, students will defend their dissertation proposal at the end of the third year. During the fourth and fifth years, as appropriate, students will work with their dissertation adviser and other faculty committee members to move through all phases of the dissertation. At this stage the research apprenticeship courses will serve to support students&rsquo; dissertation writing and cultivate their abilities to communicate with various political and social populations who are considered stakeholders in education.</p>
                <h5>Foundational Courses (nine courses—thirty-six units)</h5>
                <p><em>Foundational Core Courses</em>                 
        <p>Students will take three department foundational core courses covering designated areas of focus: transforming learning environments, transforming inequities in student outcomes, and transforming educational systems and policy. All core courses combine theory and empirical research with a design-based focus on investigating equity and diversity in educational contexts. Foundational courses are designed to provide students with a common scholarly orientation, building on the strengths of the PhD faculty and assisting students in determining their own area of focus within the framework of transforming education for a diverse society.<br>

                  <h5>Electives: Area of Focus and Cognates (five courses—twenty units)</h5>
                <p>Students will complete five content elective courses including EDS and non-EDS courses.</p>
                  <h6>Area of focus electives (two courses—eight units)</h6>
                <p>Together with their faculty adviser, students will identify an area of focus based on the foundational course topics to develop depth as transformative researchers in a specific area. Students will take two courses in their area of focus within EDS.</p>
                <h6>
                Cognate electives (two courses—eight units)</h6>
                <p>As part of the EDS commitment to cultivating new researchers, the cognate serves as a means to encourage doctoral students to design interdisciplinary research models that reflect the multiple dynamics of communities and social contexts to inform a social justice framework in education studies. The students, in conjunction with their faculty adviser, will choose at least two courses from other UC San Diego departments. Students will then seek permission to take the course from the instructor and the host department. Cognate courses may satisfy area of focus course requirements or may serve as an open elective. Examples of cognate areas include but are not limited to the following departments: ethnic studies, sociology, communication, cognitive science, psychology, and anthropology. The student will be required to have a faculty member from his or her cognate area serve on his or her dissertation committee.</p>
                <h6>Additional elective (one course—four units)</h6>
                <p>One additional elective will be selected with guidance from the student&rsquo;s adviser within EDS or outside of EDS.</p>
                <h5>Other Courses</h5>
                <p class="course-list-courses">EDS 296. Research Apprenticeship Course (ongoing two to four units each quarter). </p>
                <p>The Research Apprenticeship Course (RAC) will be led by individual education studies faculty members and designed around the current academic needs of his or her research team and student advisees introducing them to transformational research and practice in education at the local and/or national level. The Research Apprenticeship Course (RAC) is a variable unit course, taken for Pass/Not Pass credit, and repeated each quarter the student is enrolled and actively engaged with a faculty mentor on campus. The RAC provides a formal process for faculty/student mentoring and includes engagement in team research. Each RAC may conceptualize and conduct research that may result in presentations at key educational conferences and meetings and published papers. The RAC also provides support for dissertation writing.<br>
                   <br>
                  <em>First Year RAC. </em>During the first quarter of the first year, students will enroll in four units of RAC, designed to introduce them to transformational research and practice in education. During winter and spring quarters students attend the RAC of their faculty mentor. Over the two quarters they will visit at least four other RAC meetings and four different research settings to become acquainted with the variety of research settings, approaches, and topics representing EDS faculty research. This first year will provide students an opportunity to begin to form a relationship with a community educational research setting to collaborate in their dissertation project.<br>
                   <br>
                  <em>Second Year RAC (three courses—two units each quarter). </em>During the second year, the doctoral student will identify a specific group or formal organization (e.g., community organization, school/district, nonprofit educational organization, service organization, geographically distributed virtual community) to collaborate with on a design-based research project to help the organization nurture greater educational equity and access. The goals and outcomes for the research project will be a collaborative effort between the student, the faculty mentor, and the organization. This field experience provides a hands-on opportunity for students to develop research skills and dispositions for conducting quality research.<br>
                   <br>
                  <em>Third Year and Beyond RAC (2–4).</em> During the third year and beyond, the RAC will focus on dissertation development and research within the context of the design-based project. The RAC will continue to support the development of students in their overall dissertation research.</P>
                  <p class="course-list-courses">EDS 259. Communicating Research (2)</p>
                <p>An important departure from traditional graduate programs is the two-credit course to instruct students on how to communicate their scholarship to audiences beyond the academy. In the age of open access debates, universities are exploring new ways to demonstrate the relevance of research directly to nonacademic audiences. However, merely giving nonacademic audiences the opportunity to access academic scholarship does not resolve the challenges of understanding the literature. As part of the EDS commitment to education reform and change, the students will learn different avenues and tools for communicating their scholarship to education stakeholders, actively participate in discussion of education equity and access, and co-construct meaningful partnerships with educational stakeholders.</p>
                <p class="course-list-courses">EDS 299. Dissertation Research (1–12)</p>
                <p>Directed research on dissertation topic for students who have been admitted to candidacy for the PhD degree. May be repeated for credit.</p>
                <h4>Research Review: Qualifying Examination </h4>
                <p>The written research review is designed to assess the student’s ability to work in a scholarly and professional way with substantive knowledge in their area of interest. To successfully meet the research review benchmark, a student must submit a scholarly review of a research manuscript of publishable quality. The manuscript should demonstrate the student&rsquo;s knowledge of theory and research in a particular topic related to transforming education in a diverse society.</p>
                <p>To prepare for the research review, students meet with their faculty advisers to develop a reading list to guide the manuscript. The topic and scope will be articulated with the faculty adviser. The student develops the preliminary reading list on the topic and the topic adviser may add, delete, or modify the reading list to help produce a topic that is appropriate in focus and scope.</p>
                <p>The review will be submitted by the end of the second year and will be reviewed by potential dissertation committee members. The following criteria will be applied:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span><em>Pass</em>: Student is ready to progress toward a doctorate and the development of a dissertation proposal.</li>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span><em>MA Pass</em>: Student is ready to complete the project at a level expected for MA students but is not ready for doctoral-level work. Students may complete and file thesis for a terminal master&rsquo;s degree if they do not already hold one.</li>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span><em>Fail</em>: Student is not ready to progress in graduate studies.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>The Dissertation Proposal </h4>
                <p>Students may advance to candidacy in their third or fourth year of the PhD program, at the conclusion of their course work. The successful defense of their dissertation proposal before the dissertation committee constitutes the advancement to candidacy. In addition, students need to meet the qualifying exam<a href="http://grad.ucsd.edu/progress/degree-completion.html" target="_blank"> procedures</a> set forth by the Graduate Division and outlined above. The dissertation committee will be composed of five faculty members including at least one tenured faculty member from another department. Additional dissertation committee members from outside universities will be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>
                <p>The dissertation proposal should be a plan of action for a rigorous research study and must include the following elements: abstract, introduction, statement of the problem, research questions, theoretical framework, review of literature, and research design and methodology. The dissertation proposal is viewed as a fluid plan that may take on new directions in a given changing context.</p>
                  <h5>Dissertation</h5>
                <p>The dissertation is a culminating project that reflects the student&rsquo;s academic scholarship growth during the program. The project is designed with the dissertation chair and committee. Students are required to incorporate technology into their final reports and their final presentations. Our students will learn how to use presentation software and visualization tools to make powerful presentations. Members of the research population, education stakeholders, and community members will be invited to attend the final presentations and participate in an active discussion with the presenter. In addition to preparing a dissertation, students are encouraged to explore varied formats to convey findings from their dissertation study which align with the communities and populations they seek to serve through their scholarship.</p>
                <h4>Final Examination</h4>
                <p>The oral defense of the completed dissertation serves as the final exam.</p>
                <h4>Relationship of Master&rsquo;s and Doctoral Programs</h4>
                <p>A master&rsquo;s degree is not required for entrance into the PhD program. Students who complete the PhD program will receive only a PhD. However, those students who do not complete the degree, but have completed the doctoral written qualifying examination will have the opportunity to receive a terminal master&rsquo;s degree if they do not already hold one.</p>
                <h4>Normative Time of Matriculation to Degree</h4>
                <p>Precandidacy time limit—four years<br>
                  Normative time to degree—five years<br>
                  Support time limit—six years<br>
                  Total registered time—six years</p>
        <h3>Specialization in Critical Gender Studies</h3>
                <p>Students in the doctoral (PhD) program in education may apply for a specialization in critical gender studies to complement their course work and research in education studies. </p>
                <p>The Critical Gender Studies Program is built on the intellectual foundations of intersectional feminist thought and queer studies, and incorporates the interdisciplinary methodologies, intersectional frameworks, and transformational epistemologies central to contemporary gender and sexuality studies. The graduate specialization in critical gender studies provides specialized training in gender and sexuality for students currently enrolled in a UC San Diego doctoral (PhD) program. Through advanced course work in critical gender studies and its affiliated departments,&nbsp;graduate students in the specialization develop an understanding of gender as necessarily linked to other social formations, including sexuality, race, nation, religion, (dis)ability, and structures of capital.&nbsp;At the same time,&nbsp;doctoral (PhD) students engaging&nbsp;gender and sexuality studies&nbsp;have the opportunity to develop their work among peers who take up similar questions in their scholarship.</p>
                <p>Admitted students are required to complete five courses in addition to their home department&rsquo;s core requirements, consisting of two core courses and three electives. The core courses are Advanced Studies in Critical Gender Studies (CGS 200), to be taken shortly after admission to the specialization, and Practicum in Critical Gender Studies (CGS 299), to be taken in the student&rsquo;s final two years of dissertation writing. Electives may be chosen from a list of preapproved seminars in participating departments (students may petition other courses with significant gender/sexuality studies content) and may be taken at any time during the student&rsquo;s tenure at UC San Diego. Admitted students must also include at least one member of their dissertation committee from the list of CGS core or affiliate faculty.</p>
                <p>For more information about the graduate specialization in critical gender studies, please visit&nbsp;<u><a href="http://cgs.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">http://cgs.ucsd.edu</a></u>.</p>
