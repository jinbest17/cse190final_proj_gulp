<p><em>All courses, faculty listings, and curricular and degree requirements described herein are subject to change or deletion without notice. </em></p>
<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p class="basic-offset-top-only">Communication at UC San Diego is a field of study that emphasizes the role of technologies and institutions of communication, from language to television, to the internet and beyond, in mediating human experience. It draws from such social science disciplines as anthropology, psychology, sociology, and political science, and from the humanities and fine arts, including theatre, literature, and visual arts. Communication students will develop a critical awareness of the communicative forces that affect their everyday lives. </p>
				<p>The communication major is not designed as a training program in advertising, journalism, production, or public relations. It provides students with a solid liberal arts background necessary for graduate studies in communication and other disciplines, and for professional work in a number of communication-related fields, including primary and secondary education. </p>
				<p>Though the emphasis of the major is not a technical one, the faculty in the Department of Communication believe that students will develop a deeper understanding of how communication works by exploring firsthand the capabilities and limitations of a variety of media. Students, therefore, will have the opportunity to conduct part of their studies in video, computer communication, or other forms of media practice.</p>
<p class="anchor-parent"><a class="anchor" id="major"></a></p><h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">The Communication Major</h2>
				<p>Degree offered: Bachelor of Arts </p>

				<p>The Department of Communication offers an Honors Program to those students who have demonstrated excellence in the communication major.

The Honors Program requires an application. Students wishing to be considered need to include the following in their application: one faculty adviser signature who supports their admission to the program, a verified overall GPA of 3.0 and a major GPA of 3.5, and a brief but detailed description of the proposed research or creative project. </p>

Upon completion of the Honors Seminar sequence, honors will be determined as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Students with at least a 3.25 GPA in the major and a B or better in the Honors Seminar will be awarded Distinction.</li>
