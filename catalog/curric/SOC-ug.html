				<p>Sociology studies societies and human groups: their composition, organization,
				  culture, and development. It combines scientific and humanistic methods
				  to investigate a subject that is both relevant and broad—ranging from social
				  interaction in everyday life to social changes taking place on a global
				  scale. The Department of Sociology at UC San Diego offers an innovative
				  program that covers the breadth of the discipline while giving students
				  opportunities to specialize in areas of their choice, to conduct independent
				  research, and to participate in an Honors Program. The department also
				  encourages majors to study abroad and to take courses in other humanities
				  and social science departments in order to expand their perspective on
			    sociological topics. </p>
        <p>Students at UC San Diego can explore a full range of sociological inquiry through courses
                  in such established fields as Third World development, law, culture, social movements,
                  religion, race and ethnic relations, gender roles, medicine, and mental illness.
                  In addition, students have the opportunity to participate in courses found in
                  few other sociology departments, such as the politics of language, ethnographic
                  film, the Holocaust, comparative sex stratification, mass media, and revolutions.
                  The faculty also teach an exceptional array of courses focusing on specific societies
                  or world regions, including Africa, Japan, China, Latin America, eastern Europe,
                  the former Soviet Union, and the United States. </p>
        <p>Thus, sociology is a valuable major for students who want to enter law, medicine, architecture, business, or politics. It also provides a solid liberal arts education for students who plan careers in such fields as criminal justice, public health, urban planning, social welfare, counseling, public administration, international relations, or market research. For students who wish to pursue graduate study in the social sciences for careers in teaching or scholarly research, an undergraduate degree from the Department of Sociology will provide a thorough grounding in recent theoretical and methodological advances in the discipline. A sociology major offers excellent preparation for teaching in the elementary schools. If you are interested in earning a California teaching credential from UC San Diego, contact the Education Studies Program for information about the prerequisite and professional preparation requirements. It is recommended that you contact the Education Studies Program as early as possible in your academic career. Whatever the career choice, the study of sociology can help the student cultivate a critical awareness of social life. </p>
				<p>Students interested in majoring or minoring in sociology should stop by the Department of Sociology office, SSB 401, for program information and handouts. These clarify specific procedures and guidelines and provide recommendations for areas of specialization within the major, as well as for graduate studies and careers in sociology. </p>
		<p class="anchor-parent"><a class="anchor" id="ugrad"></a></p><h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">The Undergraduate Program </h2>
		<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">The Major </h3>
				<p>Students may choose to major in general sociology or in one of several concentrations, described below. Some basic requirements for the BA are common to all of these majors. All students must complete four lower-division and twelve upper-division courses in sociology. </p>
				<p>A 2.0 GPA is required in the major, and students must earn at least a
				  C– in each course used for the major. No courses taken to apply toward
				  the major <em>may be taken on a Pass/Not Pass basis except SOCI 199. </em>Only
				  one such special studies course (including internships) may be applied
				  toward the major. Special studies courses must be applied for and approved
				  by the department before the beginning of the quarter in which the student
				  wishes to enroll and can only be taken on a Pass/Not Pass basis. See the
				  staff undergraduate coordinator for the necessary application forms and
			    deadlines. </p>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Lower Division </h4>
				<p>The four lower-division requirements for a major in sociology are</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="list-level-1">SOCI , 2 and 60. (We strongly recommend you take SOCI 1 and 2 in sequence.) </li>
					<li class="list-level-1">One course from the following: SOCI 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50</li>
				</ul>
				<p>It is advisable that students complete these required lower-division courses (which should be taken during the freshman or sophomore year) before continuing with their upper-division work. SOCI 60 is a prerequisite for all upper-division methods courses. </p>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Upper Division </h4>
				<p>Twelve upper-division courses are needed for the major. SOCI 100 is required (students are strongly advised to complete this course by the end of their junior year), as well as one of the following methods courses: </p>
				<ul>
					<li class="list-level-1">SOCI 102</li>
					<li class="list-level-1">SOCI 103M</li>
					<li class="list-level-1">SOCI 104</li>
					<li class="list-level-1">SOCI 104Q</li>
					<li class="list-level-1">SOCI 105 </li>
					<li class="list-level-1">SOCI 106 </li>
					<li class="list-level-1">SOCI 106M</li>
					<li class="list-level-1">SOCI 108 </li>
					<li class="list-level-1">SOCI 109</li>
					<li class="list-level-1">SOCI 109M</li>
					<li class="list-level-1">SOCI 110 </li>
				</ul>
		<p>SOCI 60 is a prerequisite for these methods courses. </p>
				<p>Students are encouraged to complete their theory and methods courses early in their program, since theoretical perspectives and skills in methods will enhance their subsequent course work. Ten additional upper-division classes are required for the major. The specific choices will depend on the student&#8217;s major concentration. </p>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Requirements for Major in General Sociology</h3>
				<p>Students who seek a BA in general sociology may complete any ten additional upper-division sociology classes.</p>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Requirements for Major Concentrations</h4>
				<p>Students may graduate with a BA in one of seven concentrations by choosing at least five upper-division classes from the course offerings in that concentration, as part of the ten upper-division courses for the major. Only one major concentration is allowed. </p>
				<h5 class="program-overview-subhead-4">Concentration in International Studies</h5>
				<p>Students may graduate with a BA in sociology/international studies by completing at least five of the following courses as part of the ten upper-division courses required for the major. This concentration would be especially appropriate for those interested in international business, foreign service, or international law.</p>

				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Education Abroad Program </h4>
				<p>Students are encouraged to participate in the UC Education Abroad Program (EAP) or UC San Diego’s Opportunities Abroad Program (OAP) while still making progress toward completing their major. Students considering this option should discuss their plans with the undergraduate adviser prior to going abroad, and courses taken abroad must be approved by the department. It may be possible to use some related courses outside of the discipline of sociology toward the major. For more information on EAP, see the section of this catalog on the <a href="EAP.html">Education Abroad Program</a>. Interested students should contact the Study Abroad UC San Diego Office in the International Center. To petition particular courses taken abroad, see the undergraduate adviser in the Department of Sociology. </p>

<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Recommendations for Transfer Students </h3>
				<p>Students transferring from a community college or other university may petition for sociology credit for courses taken at their previous institution. For students transferring from the California Community College System, articulation agreements for many courses have been developed that facilitate the petition process.</p>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Transferring Lower-Division Credit</h4>
				<p>The four lower-division requirements for a major in sociology are</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="list-level-1">SOCI 1, 2, and 60: Articulations exist at most community colleges</li>
					<li class="list-level-1">SOCI 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50: If your community college does not offer an already articulated course, please see the undergraduate coordinator for information about petitioning potential lower-division sociology transfer credit.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>It is important to note that eight of the twelve upper-division courses in the undergraduate program must be taken in the Department of Sociology at UC San Diego, unless students obtain special acceptance of additional courses from the chair and the faculty undergraduate adviser. </p>
		<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">The Minor </h3>
				<p>The minor consists of seven sociology courses: two lower division and five upper division. Unless colleges specify specific courses to be taken, the student may choose any two lower-division sociology courses (SOCI  1, 2, 10, 20, 30, 40, or 60) and any five upper-division courses (SOCI  100 to 190). Courses for the minor must be taken for a letter grade only. Special study courses or internships may not be applied toward the minor.</p>
		<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">The Honors Program </h3>
				<p>The Department of Sociology offers an honors program to those students who have demonstrated excellence in the sociology major. Successful completion of the honors program enables the student to graduate With Highest Distinction, With High Distinction, or With Distinction, depending upon performance in the program. </p>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Eligibility </h4>
		<p>Students may apply to the honors program if they meet the following requirements: </p>
				<ol>
				  <li>junior standing (ninety units completed) </li>
				  <li>GPA of 3.5 or better in the major </li>
				  <li>recommendation of a faculty sponsor familiar with student&#8217;s
				    work </li>
				  <li>must have completed at least four upper-division sociology courses </li>
				  <li>overall GPA of 3.2 or better </li>
				  <li>must have completed SOCI 100 and one upper-division methods course
				    prior to the fall quarter when the honors course begins;
				    alternatively, the consent of the honors program director
				    or the undergraduate adviser must be obtained </li>
	    </ol>
		<p>Interested students may pick up an application from the staff undergraduate coordinator in the Department of Sociology. Completed applications must be in the department office no later than week five of the spring quarter prior to the start of the honors program in the fall. </p>
				<p>Students traveling abroad during their junior year should note that the deadline for applications still applies to them and should make arrangements accordingly. </p>
				<p>Enrollment in the honors program is limited. Final decisions on acceptance into the program will be made by the presiding faculty member. </p>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Course Requirement </h4>
				<p>The student must take SOCI 196A, Advanced Studies in Sociology, and SOCI 196B, Supervised Thesis Research, which will count as two of the twelve upper-division courses required for the major. Each student will choose a faculty adviser to help supervise the thesis research and writing with the honors program director. </p>
				<p>Students whose GPA in the major falls below 3.5 or who do not earn at
				  least an A– in the honors seminars will not graduate with distinction,
				  but they may count the two honors courses among the twelve
				  upper-division courses required for the major. Students must
				  maintain a 3.5 GPA in the major and a 3.2 overall GPA until final graduation,
				  in order to receive honors in the sociology honors program. To graduate
				  With Highest Distinction the student must earn an A+; to graduate With
				  High Distinction the student must earn an A; and to graduate With Distinction
				  the grade must be an A–. </p>
