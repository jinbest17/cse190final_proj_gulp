<h2>The Department of Urban Studies and Planning</h2>
<p>Cities are now home to more than half of the people on earth—and this proportion is increasing rapidly. The number of city dwellers is projected to grow to 6.4 billion by 2050, making the planet&rsquo;s population two-thirds urban. Global urbanization is one of the twenty-first century&rsquo;s most complex and transformative trends worldwide. Accordingly, the United Nations adopted a New Urban Agenda in 2016 to set global standards for sustainable urban development, addressing how cities, their neighborhoods, and the regions in which they are situated are planned, designed, financed, developed, governed, and managed. Sustainable urban development will require a significant change in the ways in which we plan, build, and live in human settlements. Cities across the world will need to balance population growth, land scarcity, social and economic equity, demographic shifts, and climate-change related adaption. The Department of Urban Studies and Planning recognizes the critical importance of educating the next generation of urban problem solvers and offers two undergraduate degrees: the BA in urban studies and planning and the BS in real estate and development.</p>
<p>The Department of Urban Studies and Planning has a rich history dating back to 1971. It is a diverse community of students, faculty, and staff with a broad range of interests and goals. The department has three undergraduate student clubs and student chapters or affiliations with prominent organizations such as NAIOP, the Urban Land Institute, the American Planning Association, the Association of Environmental Professionals, and the Construction Management Association of America. Urban studies and planning provides students with the opportunity to engage in experiential learning, place-based research, internships, and practicum experiences focused on issues such as community economic development, physical planning, urban design, affordable housing, real estate development, sustainable development, transportation policy, healthy placemaking, and active living. The Department of Urban Studies and Planning provides students with a solid foundation for graduate study or for professional work in a number of fields in the public, private, and nonprofit sectors both domestically and internationally. After graduation, some alumni pursue graduate work in social science disciplines. Others pursue graduate studies in urban planning, real estate development, public policy, law, landscape architecture, or architecture. The Department of Urban Studies and Planning also attracts students interested in medicine and public-health issues who continue to study in these areas at schools of medicine or public health. Many students find employment opportunities through internship placements. More generally, graduates of the Urban Studies and Planning Program will have the analytic skills to think clearly and act creatively about the problems and prospects of neighborhoods, cities, and metropolitan regions. </p>
<p class="anchor-parent"><a class="anchor" id="major"></a></p><h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">The Urban Studies and Planning Major </h2>
				<p>The urban studies and planning major provides students with a variety of perspectives for understanding the development, growth, and culture of cities and the communities within them. Course work introduces students to the ways different disciplines understand cities and the societies of which they are a part. Upper-division requirements educate students about the parameters within which urban choices are made. The urban studies and planning major is the oldest and most comprehensive undergraduate urban planning degree program in the University of California system.</p>
				<p>One of the outstanding features of the urban studies and planning major  is the upper-division senior sequence—an integrated research, internship, and writing requirement. During the two-quarter senior sequence, designed to be taken in the fall and winter of the senior year, all USP majors learn how to write a research proposal, carry out the proposed research, and share the results in the form of a scholarly thesis, poster, and video. The posters go on display at USP&rsquo;s well-attended annual Urban Expo. The senior sequence allows students to self-select a topic of interest and work on specific planning, policy, urban design, and development projects in San Diego and the surrounding region, including sites across the international border in Mexico. Eligible students may choose to enroll in USP 190 in the spring to write an honors thesis. The honors option is an opportunity to do advanced research and writing that builds on work already completed in the senior sequence. </p>
                <p>A bachelor of arts degree in urban studies and planning will be given to students who satisfactorily complete the general-education requirements of Muir, Revelle, Marshall, Warren, Roosevelt, or Sixth College in addition to the urban studies and planning courses described below. The undergraduate program in urban studies and planning requires a four-quarter lower-division sequence in urban studies (USP 1-2-3-4), POLI 30, and twelve courses in upper-division urban studies and planning. Students are encouraged to complete the lower-division prerequisites before they enroll in the upper-division courses. </p>
<p>In accordance with campus academic regulations, courses used to satisfy the major cannot be applied toward a minor, although some overlap is allowed for double majors. All lower-division and upper-division requirements must be taken for a letter grade. A 2.0 grade point average is required in the major, and students must earn at least C– in each course used for the major. Transfer students should see the USP major affairs adviser to determine whether courses taken elsewhere satisfy USP major requirements. No more than one special studies course, USP 198 or USP 199, will be accepted to count toward the major. </p>
		<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Lower-Division Requirements </h3>
				<p>Students majoring in urban studies and planning must complete the introductory sequence: </p>
				<p class="course-list-overview">USP 1. History of US Urban Communities (4) </p>

                <h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Senior Sequence Requirement </h4>
				<p>In their senior year, all students must complete the senior sequence: USP 186 in the fall, and USP 187 in the winter. These courses must be taken <em>in order</em>. The sequence develops each student&rsquo;s ability to (1) critically review research literature; (2) formulate interesting research questions of their own; (3) design an original research project and investigative strategy; (4) conduct research; and (5) analyze, interpret, and write up findings. The final requirement of USP 186 is a research proposal. By the end of USP 187, each student must complete a Senior Research Project that includes a scholarly thesis coupled with a poster and video designed to share the research with select audiences.</p>
<p>Because the senior sequence includes an internship, no other internship or field placement will be counted toward the major. Students are required to complete USP 124 prior to enrolling in USP 186.</p>
		<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Honors in Urban Studies and Planning </h4>

				<h3>The Urban Studies and Planning Minor                </h3>
				<p>The urban studies and planning minor consists of seven courses in urban studies and planning, selected with the prior approval of the USP student affairs adviser. Students who wish to minor in urban studies may do so by taking any two courses from among the lower-division sequence and the upper-division foundation courses, and five upper-division courses from among those that serve the USP major. All courses must be taken for a letter grade not lower than a C–. Courses selected need approval from the USP undergraduate  adviser. Students can declare the minor online. </p>
        <h2>The Real Estate and Development Major</h2>
				<p>The real estate and development (RED) major at UC San Diego is one of the most comprehensive undergraduate programs of its kind in the country. It recognizes that the next generation of real estate and development innovators will need to understand the nexus between real estate finance and development, data analysis, urban planning and design, environmental regulations, and new technologies. The major also emphasizes the importance of public-private partnerships and knowledge of the role and function of the public, private, and nonprofit sectors at the neighborhood, city, and regional level. It recognizes the importance of supplementing classroom instruction with professional development opportunities and uses the San Diego-Tijuana city-region as a living laboratory for hands-on, project-based learning.</p>
				<p>The curriculum for the bachelor of science in RED is broad and interdisciplinary in response to the diverse ways in which real estate impacts the ways people live, work, and enrich their lives. Required courses include economics, business management, urban planning, real estate finance, real estate law, sustainable development, and urban design. All course work is designed to facilitate qualitative, quantitative, analytical, strategic, design, and problem-solving, solutions-oriented skills. Students pursuing the RED major are    encouraged to pair their degree with a minor degree in urban studies and planning or one of the many minor degrees offered at UC San Diego, particularly those offered by the Rady School of Management including the minor in business and the minor in entrepreneurship and innovation.</p>
				<p>One of the outstanding features of the real estate and development major is the upper-division capstone studio requirement. During a two-quarter &ldquo;Capstone Studio Sequence,&rdquo; designed to be taken in fall and winter of the senior year, all RED majors are guided through a hands-on, actual real estate finance and development project. Through project-based learning, students work in teams culminating with the presentation of their findings at the annual Urban Expo hosted by the Urban Studies and Planning Program.</p>
				<p>A bachelor of science degree in RED will be given to students who satisfactorily complete the general-education requirements of Muir, Revelle, Marshall, Warren, Roosevelt, or Sixth College in addition to the real estate and sustainable development courses described below. The undergraduate RED major requires eight lower-division courses, ten upper-division courses, and the required two-quarter Capstone Studio Sequence. Students are strongly encouraged to complete the lower-division requirements before they enroll in the upper-division courses.</p>
				<h3>Lower-Division Requirements</h3>
