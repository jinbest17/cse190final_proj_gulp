<p><em>All courses, faculty listings, and curricular and degree requirements described herein are subject to change or deletion without notice. </em></p>
<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p>Ethnic studies at UC San Diego is an interdisciplinary field of study that focuses on fundamental theoretical and political questions regarding the social construction of categories of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, and nation. The department&rsquo;s innovative approach represents a commitment to transnational, relational, and intersectional methods for producing critical knowledge about power and inequality, including systems of knowledge that have emerged from racialized and indigenous communities in global contexts. The department&rsquo;s areas of focus include aesthetics, performance, and cultural production; materialist approaches to labor, value, and consumption; science and technology; and (settler) colonialism, migration, and movement.</p>
<p>With outstanding teachers and excellently trained teaching assistants, undergraduates in the Department of Ethnic Studies have a valuable opportunity to engage in a lively and supportive academic environment. The curriculum of the Department of Ethnic Studies is designed to teach students to</p>
<ul>
  <li>Conduct interdisciplinary research in comparative race and ethnic studies       </li>
  <li>Communicate complex ideas about society effectively, particularly in oral and written form</li>
  <li>Critically analyze power and inequality in a global focus, in preparation for an international world</li>
  <li>Articulate the historical, cultural, and social contexts of specific racial, ethnic, and other social formations, in preparation for our diverse society</li>
  <li>Demonstrate practical experience in ethnic studies, other than academic writing and reading, such as through performance, art, direct service, internships, and study abroad.
    </ul>
<p>Ethnic studies is an exciting degree that prepares students to enter the workforce and function effectively and critically as informed citizens in a diverse multicultural society. The major offers a solid liberal arts education for students considering admission to graduate or professional schools and careers in education, law, medicine, public health, social work, counseling, journalism, business, city planning, politics, psychology, international relations, or creative writing.</p>

				<p class="anchor-parent"><a class="anchor" id="major"></a></p><h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">The Major </h2>
				<p>To receive a BA with a major in ethnic studies, students must meet the following requirements: </p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Two lower-division courses from either Ethnic Studies 1-2-3. Ideally these two lower-division courses should be taken during the sophomore year as an intensive introduction to the history and theoretical dimensions of ethnic diversity in the United States.  Ethnic Studies 1, 2, and 3, Introduction to Ethnic Studies, will consist of the following three courses: Land and Labor, Circulations of Difference, and Making Culture.</li>
				  <li>A minimum of thirteen four-unit upper-division courses in the Department
				    of Ethnic Studies must be completed from the following:</li>

                   <li>Ethnic studies majors, including students who are double majors,

				    major requirements as long as each of the following three conditions
				    is met for each course: (1) the course is taken from another UC San Diego
				    department, taken from a UC San Diego approved study abroad program, or taken
				    at another UC campus; and (2) the course work is appropriate to the ethnic
				    studies major.</li>
				  <li>To satisfy the requirements for the major, lower- and upper-division
				    courses must be completed with a P, C–, or better grade.</li>
				  <li>Except for independent study course electives (ETHN 197, 198, or
				    199) which are always taken with a Pass/Not Pass grade option,
				    students majoring in ethnic studies may take up to two courses, either
				    lower or upper division, with a Pass/Not Pass option. </li>
	    </ol>
<h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">The Honors Program </h2>
				<p>Consistent with other research opportunities offered to undergraduates on the UC San Diego campus, the department offers ethnic studies majors in their senior or junior year the opportunity to conduct original research using interdisciplinary methodologies in the comparative study of race and ethnicity. To enroll in the Honors Program, an undergraduate must have a minimum grade point average of 3.5 in ethnic studies classes counted toward the major. Students with a GPA lower than 3.5 in the major may be admitted by exception if they show promise of success in research. </p>
				<p>Candidates for Honors in Ethnic Studies will be required to take ETHN 100H, Honors Research Design, a four-unit discussion-based course on advanced research methods; and ETHN 196, Honors Thesis Research, a four-unit independent study with a thesis director who will be either an ethnic studies faculty member or an ethnic studies affiliated faculty member. At the end of spring quarter, honors students will provide an overview of their thesis findings at a one-day symposium. Students who complete ETHN 100H and ETHN 196H will receive credit toward the total number of ten upper-division electives required for the ethnic studies major. Both courses must be taken for a grade. Students who complete the research project with a grade of A+ will receive Highest Distinction, a grade of A receives High Distinction, and a grade of B or greater receives Distinction in the major upon graduation from UC San Diego. </p>
        <p class="course-name">ETHN 100H. Honors Research Design (4)</p>
        <p>This discussion-based course will focus on the application of advanced research methods to the design of extensive, independent research-based projects.</p>
        <p class="course-name">ETHN 196H. Honors Thesis (4)</p>
        <p>This course will focus on writing an Honors thesis under the supervision of a thesis adviser, who will be either an Ethnic Studies faculty or an Ethnic Studies affiliated faculty member. While not required, students are encouraged to take ETHN 100C: Social Justice Praxis concurrently with 196H.</p>
<h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">Education Abroad Program</h2>
				<p>Students are able to participate in the UC Education Abroad Program (EAP) or UC San Diego&#8217;s Opportunities Abroad Program (OAP) while still making progress toward completing their major. Students considering this option should discuss their plans with the undergraduate adviser prior to going abroad, and courses taken abroad must be approved by the department. Interested students should contact the Study Abroad UC San Diego office near Matthews Quad.</p>
				<p class="anchor-parent"><a class="anchor" id="minor"></a></p><h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">The Minor </h2>
		<p>Students may minor in ethnic studies. Students wishing to minor in ethnic studies must satisfy the following requirements: </p>
				<ol>
				  <li>A total of seven courses will satisfy the minor program with two options as follows:</li>
		
				<ul class="no-bullet">
				  <li class="no-bullet">Option 1, the lower-division option: Students must take two of the lower-division courses from ETHN 1, ETHN 2 or ETHN 3. Students must also take five four-unit upper-division ethnic studies courses from the upper-division electives (see list for ethnic studies electives).</li>
				  <li class="no-bullet">Or</li>
				  <li class="no-bullet">Option 2, the upper-division option: Students must take ETHN 100A and ETHN 100B. Students must also take five four-unit upper-division ethnic studies courses from the upper-division electives (see list for ethnic studies electives).</li>

				  <p>Students choose only one option to satisfy the minor requirement.  </p>
				  <p>No more than one independent study course (ETHN 197, 198, or 199) may be petitioned to count for the minor.</p>
				
                  <li>To satisfy the requirements for the minor, lower- and upper-division
