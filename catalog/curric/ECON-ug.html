				<p>Economics is the study of how individuals, organizations, and societies deal with scarcity—the fact that resources are not sufficient to satisfy everyone&#8217;s wants. Because scarcity requires choice among alternative uses of resources, economists study both the technology by which resources are turned into the products people want and the preferences through which people choose among alternatives. Further, since society is composed of many individuals and groups, economists study markets, governments, and other institutions through which a society might gain the advantages of cooperation and resolve the conflicts due to competing goals. The economics curriculum develops tools and uses them to analyze a wide range of societal problems, and also to study the role of the government in solving these problems. </p>
				<p>Economics is a different discipline from business administration. However, there are substantial overlaps. Both disciplines study the behavior of people and firms within the context of market, legal, and other institutions. In evaluating economic institutions, economists tend to emphasize the viewpoint of the larger society, and business scholars tend to emphasize
			    the viewpoint of firms. </p>
				<p>Information on the undergraduate program can be found on the undergraduate program&#8217;s website at <a href="http://economics.ucsd.edu/undergraduate-program/index.html" target="_blank">http://economics.ucsd.edu/undergraduate-program/index.html</a>. The website contains answers to frequently asked questions, gives practical tips for avoiding problems, and provides a more detailed discussion of the department&rsquo;s majors than is possible in the general catalog. It is important for students contemplating a major in the department to be familiar with the website and the prerequisite requirements listed therein. Students communicate with undergraduate advisers in the department either through in-person walk-in advising sessions, or through the Virtual Advising Center (VAC). VAC (<a href="http://vac.ucsd.edu" target="_blank">vac.ucsd.edu</a>) documents student questions and department responses.&nbsp;It also authenticates student identity and protects student information. Students must use their UC San Diego email address to send and receive messages in VAC.</p>
				<p>The Department of Economics hosts the EconUGBlog (<a href="http://econugblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">http://econugblog.wordpress.com/</a>) to provide information to undergraduate students about events, jobs, and internship opportunities related to economics. &nbsp; </p>

		<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Lower-Division Economics Courses </h3>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Microeconomics and Macroeconomics—ECON
				  1-2-3</h4>
				<p>The department offers three lower-division economics classes, ECON 1-2-3. ECON 1 is an introduction to the study of the economic system from the micro, or individual decision maker&#8217;s perspective. The focus of ECON 1 is the allocation of resources and the distribution of income in perfectly competitive markets. ECON 2 is a continuation of the study of microeconomics with a focus on the allocation of resources in monopoly and other imperfectly competitive markets, market imperfections, and the role of government in markets. ECON 3 introduces macroeconomics: unemployment, inflation, business cycles, and monetary and fiscal policy. ECON 1 is a prerequisite for both ECON 2 and ECON 3. ECON 2 and ECON 3 can be taken in any order and may be taken concurrently. </p>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Accounting Course </h3>
				<p>The department offers an accounting course, ECON 4. ECON 4 is a lower-division requirement for the BS in management science and the management science minor. ECON 4 is cross-listed with MGT 4. Students will not receive credit for ECON 4 if taken after MGT 4.</p>
                <div>
                  <div> </div>
                </div>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Upper-Division Economics Core Courses </h3>
				<p>The upper-division economics and management science core courses are expected to be offered every quarter (fall, winter, and spring) with the following exceptions:  </p>
				<p class="course-list-overview">Fall—no ECON 172B</p>
				<p class="course-list-overview">Spring—no ECON 172A or 173A</p>
				<p class="basic-offset-top-only">The 100, 110, 120, 172, and 173 core courses are sequential. That is, A must be taken before B, and when applicable, B before C.				</p>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">The Economics Major (BA) </h3>
				<p>The economics BA program is designed to provide a broad understanding
				  of resource-allocation and income-determination mechanisms. Both the development
				  of the tools of economic analysis and their application to contemporary
				  problems and public policy are stressed. </p>
				<p>When choosing which mathematics series to take, MATH 10A-B-C or MATH 20A-B-C, it is important to remember that only MATH 20A-B-C allows students access to MATH 20F and several upper-division mathematics courses that are recommended as preparation for PhD study in economics and business administration, as well as for graduate studies for professional management degrees, including the MBA. Therefore, while we require economics majors to take MATH 10A-B-C, we recommend that economics students take MATH 20A-B-C.</p>
		<p>A student majoring in economics must meet the following requirements: </p>
				<ol>
				  <li> Lower-division mathematics courses. MATH 10A-B-C (required) or
			      MATH 20A-B-C (recommended). </li>
				  <li>Lower-division economics courses. ECON 1 and ECON 3. </li>
				  <li>Upper-division economics core courses. ECON 100A-B-C (microeconomics),
			      ECON 110A-B (macroeconomics), and ECON 120A-B-C (econometrics). </li>
				  <li>Upper-division economics electives. Five more economics courses
				    at the upper-division level. <em>At least</em> two of these elective
				    courses must be “advanced electives.” The economics advanced
				    electives are<p></p>
				    <p class="course-list-courses">ECON 103. International Monetary Relations</p>
				    <p class="course-list-courses">ECON 105. Industrial Organization and Firm Strategy</p>
				     <p class="course-list-courses">ECON 109. Game Theory</p>

			      </li>
				  <li>
				    Note that the prerequisites for advanced economics electives are completion of core courses. Therefore, economics majors are strongly encouraged to take ECON 100A-B-C and ECON 120A-B-C in their sophomore year. Please check course descriptions for exact prerequisites.
</li>
		</ol>
		<p class="basic-offset-top-only">A detailed description of the economics major, as well as two- and four-year plans, are available in the Undergraduate Program section of the department website:  <a href="http://economics.ucsd.edu/undergraduate-program/index.html" target="_blank">http://economics.ucsd.edu/undergraduate-program/index.html</a>. 
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">The Management Science Major (BSc) </h3>
				<p>Management science builds on a set of related quantitative methods commonly used to solve problems arising in the private (business and finance) and public (government) sectors. While students will gain some familiarity with the traditional functional fields of business management, this program is more tightly focused and more quantitative than a traditional business administration major. It is not, however, a program in applied mathematics or operational research, since the economic interpretation and application of the tools are continually stressed. Rather, it is a quantitative major in applied economics with a management focus. </p>
				<p>A student majoring in management science must meet the following requirements:</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Lower-division mathematics courses. MATH 20A-B-C and MATH 18.</li>
				  <li>Lower-division economics courses. ECON 1, ECON 3, and ECON 4.</li>
				  <li>Upper-division economics core courses. ECON 100A-B-C (microeconomics),
				    ECON 120A-B-C (econometrics), ECON 171 (decisions under uncertainty),
			      ECON 172A-B (operations research), and ECON 173A-B (finance).</li>
				  <li> Upper-division economics electives. Four more economics courses
				    at the upper-division level. At least two of these elective
				    courses must be “advanced electives.” The management science
				    advanced electives are<p></p>

				  </li>
	    </ol>
				<p>Note that many of these advanced management science electives recommend 100C as a prerequisite for the class. In the fall quarter of 2010, 100C became a prerequisite for the advanced electives that currently only recommend 100C as a prerequisite. Therefore, management science majors are strongly encouraged to take ECON 100A-B-C and ECON 120A-B-C in their sophomore year. </p>
				<p>A detailed description of the management science major, as well as two- and four-year plans, are available in the Undergraduate Program section of the department website: <a href="http://economics.ucsd.edu/undergraduate-program/index.html" target="_blank">http://economics.ucsd.edu/undergraduate-program/index.html</a>. </p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Joint Major in Mathematics and Economics
				  (BSc) </h3>
				<p>This major is considered to be excellent preparation for the PhD study in economics and business administration, as well as for graduate studies for professional management degrees, including the MBA.</p>
				<p>Majors in economics generally recognize the importance of mathematics to their discipline. Undergraduate students who plan to pursue doctoral study in economics or business need the more advanced mathematics training prescribed in this major. Majors in mathematics often feel the need for a more formal introduction to issues involving business applications of science and mathematics. Extending their studies into economics provides this application and can provide a bridge to successful careers or advanced study. This major provides a formal framework making it easier to combine study in economics and mathematics. </p>
				<p>Course requirements of the joint major in mathematics and economics consist principally of the required courses of the mathematics major and the economics/management science majors: </p>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Lower-Division Requirements </h4>

        <h3>The Bachelor of Arts in Economics—Public Policy and Master of Public Policy (BA/MPP)</h3>
				<h4>Requirements for Admission</h4>
				<p>The BA/MPP is a five-year program offered jointly by the Department of Economics and the School of Global Policy and Strategy (GPS). Students interested in pursuing the BA/MPP must be currently enrolled in the Department of Economics at UC San Diego, and a declared economics BA major. Students who meet the admissions requirements listed below may apply to the combined degree track of Economics—Public Policy, BA and a Master of Public Policy in the spring quarter of their junior year.</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
    <li>Completion of fall and      winter quarters of the junior year with a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.00      and a minimum 3.4 GPA in Department of Economics upper-division course      work.</li>
      <li>Satisfactory completion of      the Department of Economics upper-division sequences: ECON 100A-B-C, ECON 110      A-B, and ECON 120A-B-C.</li>
      <li>Completion of all parts of      the application as indicated on the GPS admissions website and      <a href="http://apply.grad.ucsd.edu" target="_blank">apply.grad.ucsd.edu</a>.</li>
      <li>Students will also be      required to complete a noncredit, professional internship in the field of      public policy during the summer, prior to matriculation to graduate      standing in the MPP program.</li>
      <li>Some admitted students may      be required to attend summer preparation courses in writing prior to the      beginning of their first year in the program.</li>

</ol>
                <p>Applicants will be admitted to the combined degree program on the basis of demonstrated academic excellence in upper-division course work in the Department of Economics, leadership, community involvement, and demonstrated interest in public policy.</p>
<h4>The BA/MPP Curriculum </h4>
                <p>Students interested in the BA/MPP must initially enroll as economics majors and complete the lower-division and upper-division sequences required for the BA in economics. Once admitted to the BA/MPP program by GPS, however, instead of five upper-division Department of Economics electives as required for the standard major, Economics—Public Policy students will have a requirement of four. Two of these electives must be in the Department of Economics. GPCO 404, Market Failures, and GPCO 406, Public Finance and Taxation, taken at GPS in the senior year, will count for the other two electives.</p>
