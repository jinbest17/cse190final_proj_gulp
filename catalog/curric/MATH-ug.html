				<p>The mathematics department offers a wide range of courses in pure and applied mathematics for its majors and for students in other disciplines. The department offers seven majors leading to the BS: mathematics, applied mathematics, mathematics—computer science, joint major in mathematics and economics, mathematics—scientific computation, mathematics—applied science and probability and statistics, and one leading to the BA: mathematics—secondary education. In addition, students can minor in mathematics or mathematics education. The department also has an Honors Program for exceptional students in any of the eight majors. See the sections on major programs and the other areas mentioned above as well as the course descriptions at the end of this section for more specific information about program requirements and the courses offered by the department. You may visit our website, <a href="http://math.ucsd.edu" target="_blank">http://math.ucsd.edu</a>, for more information, including course web pages, career advising, and research interests of our faculty. </p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">First-Year Courses </h3>
				<p>Entering students must take the Mathematics Placement Exam (MPE) prior to orientation unless they have an appropriate score on an AP calculus exam, an appropriate score (600 for MATH 1A; 650 for MATH 20A) on the SAT II Math Level 2 exam, an appropriate score on the International Baccalaureate Higher Level Mathematics Exam, credit by means of a foreign exam (e.g. GCE), or transferable college credit in calculus. The purpose of the MPE is to recommend placement for entering students in MATH 3C, 4C, 10A, or 20A. Students can also receive placement into MATH 18 (Linear Algebra). For more information about the MPE (test dates, test description, sample exams, online practice tests), see the Mathematics Testing and Placement website, <a href="http://mathtesting.ucsd.edu" target="_blank">http://mathtesting.ucsd.edu</a>. </p>
				<p>Prerequisites for MATH 3C, 4C, 10A-B-C, 18, 20A-B-C-D-E, and 31AH-BH-CH are enforced through <a href="http://tritonlink.ucsd.edu" target="_blank">TritonLink</a>. Students need to ensure that test scores and transferable college credit are submitted to the Registrar prior to enrollment through <a href="http://tritonlink.ucsd.edu" target="_blank">TritonLink</a>. </p>
				<p>MATH 3C is the department&#8217;s preparatory course for the MATH 10 sequence, providing a review of algebraic skills, facility in graphing, and working with exponential and logarithmic functions. </p>
				<p>MATH 4C is the department&#8217;s preparatory course for the MATH 20 sequence, providing a brief review of college algebra followed by an introduction to trigonometry and a more advanced treatment of graphing and functions. </p>
				<p>MATH 10A-B-C is one of three calculus sequences. The students in this sequence have completed a minimum of two years of high school mathematics. This sequence is intended for majors in liberal arts and the social and life sciences. It fulfills the mathematics requirements of Revelle College and the option of the general-education requirements of Muir College. Completion of two quarters fulfills the requirement of Marshall College and the option of Warren College and Eleanor Roosevelt College. </p>
				<p>MATH 18 (formerly numbered MATH 20F) is our lower-division course in linear algebra. This course sits outside the traditional calculus sequence (either 10A-B-C or 20A-B-C) and can be taken concurrent with any of these courses.</p>
<p>The second first-year calculus sequence, MATH 20A-B-C, is taken mainly
				  by students who have completed four years of high school mathematics
				  or have taken a college level precalculus course such as MATH
				  4C. This sequence fulfills all college level requirements met
				  by MATH 10A-B-C and is required of many majors, including
				  chemistry and biochemistry, bioengineering, cognitive science,
				  economics, mathematics, molecular biology, psychology, MAE,
				  CSE, ECE, and physics. Students with adequate backgrounds in
				  mathematics are strongly encouraged to take MATH 20 since
				  it provides the foundation for MATH 20D and 20E, which are required
	    for some science and engineering majors.</p>
<p>Certain transfers between the MATH 10 and MATH 20 sequences are possible, but such transfers should be carefully discussed with an adviser. Able students who begin the MATH 10 sequence and who wish to transfer to the MATH 20 sequence, may follow one of three paths: </p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Follow MATH 10A with MATH 20A, with two units of credit given
				    for MATH 20A. This option is not available if the student
			      has credit for MATH 10B or MATH 10C. </li>
				  <li>Follow MATH 10B with MATH 20B, receiving two units of credit for
			      MATH 20B. </li>
				  <li>Follow MATH 10C with MATH 20B, receiving two units of credit for
			      MATH 20B and two units of credit for MATH 20C (if taken). </li>
	    </ol>
		<p>Credit will not be given for courses taken simultaneously from the MATH 10 and the MATH 20 sequence. </p>
				<p>The department also offers a three-quarter Honors Calculus sequence in Multivariable and Vector Calculus and Linear Algebra. This sequence, MATH 31AH-BH-CH, is designed for well-prepared students who have both a strong aptitude and a deep interest in mathematics and who wish to undertake a challenging series of courses. The sequence has a prerequisite of a score of 5 on the AP Calculus BC exam. These demanding, proof-based courses cover the material in MATH 18, 20C, and 20E respectively—and entering students with a 5 on the Calculus BC exam should consider starting in the Honors sequence if their major (or minor) program requires them to take, at least, MATH 18 and 20A-B-C. Math majors who complete the entire three-quarter honors sequence will have also satisfied the requirement of MATH 109 for their major program. They would be able to replace MATH 109 with any four-unit upper-division mathematics elective course.</p>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Major Programs </h3>
				<p>The department offers seven different majors leading to the BS: (1) mathematics, (2) applied mathematics, (3) mathematics—computer science, (4) joint major in mathematics and economics, (5) mathematics—scientific computation, (6) mathematics-applied science, and (7) probability and statistics, and one leading to the BA: (1) mathematics—secondary education. The specific emphases and course requirements for these majors are described in the following sections. All majors must obtain a minimum 2.0 grade point average in the upper-division courses used to satisfy the major requirements. Further, the student must receive a grade of C– or better in any course to be counted toward fulfillment of the major requirements. Any mathematics course numbered 100–194 may be used as an upper-division elective. (<strong>Note:</strong> 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, and 199H cannot be used toward any mathematics major.) All courses used to fulfill the major must be taken for a letter grade. No more than three upper-division courses taken externally from UC San Diego can be counted toward any major. Special exceptions may be considered via petition. </p>
<p>It is strongly recommended that all mathematics majors review their programs at least annually with a departmental adviser, and that they consult with the Advising Office in AP&amp;M 6016 before making any changes to their programs. Current course offering information for the entire academic year is maintained on the department&#8217;s web page at <a href="http://math.ucsd.edu" target="_blank">http://math.ucsd.edu</a>. Special announcements are also emailed to all majors. </p>
				<p>Students who plan to go on to complete a PhD in mathematics should be
	    advised that only the best and most motivated students are admitted. Many graduate schools expect that students will have completed a full sequence of abstract algebra (MATH 100A-B-C) as well as a full sequence of analysis (MATH 140A-B-C). The advanced Graduate Record Exam (GRE) often has questions that pertain to material covered in the last quarter of analysis or algebra. In addition, it is advisable that students consider Summer Research Experiences for Undergraduates. This is a program funded by the National Science Foundation to introduce students to math research while they are still undergraduates. In their senior year or earlier, students should consider taking some graduate courses so that they are exposed to material taught at a higher level. In their junior year, students should begin to think of obtaining letters of recommendation from professors who are familiar with their abilities. </p>
				<p><strong>Note: </strong>MATH 20D and 20E do not need to be taken in order. Math majors are strongly advised to take 18 as early as possible (i.e., it can be taken concurrent with 20A, 20B, or 20C). </p>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Education Abroad </h3>
				<p>Students may be able to participate in the UC Education Abroad Program
				  (EAP) and UC San Diego&#8217;s Opportunities Abroad Program (OAP) while
				  still making progress toward the major. Students interested
				  in this option should contact the Study Abroad UC San Diego office in
				  the Matthews Quad Building and discuss their plans with the mathematics advising
		  officer before going abroad. </p>
				<p>The department must approve courses taken abroad. Information on EAP/OAP
				  can be found in the “<a href="EAP.html">Education Abroad Program</a>”
				  section of the<em> UC San Diego
				  General Catalog
</em> and the website <a href="http://studyabroad.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">http://studyabroad.ucsd.edu/</a>. </p>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Major in Mathematics </h3>
				<p>The upper-division curriculum provides programs for mathematics majors as well as courses for students who will use mathematics as a tool in the biological, physical and behavioral sciences, and the humanities. </p>
