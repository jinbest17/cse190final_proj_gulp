<p>The master of arts in Latin American studies is designed for students who seek to integrate a broad range of disciplinary approaches to a world region of growing international significance. Upon graduation, most students pursue additional advanced degrees in academic or professional fields; others proceed to careers in the private sector, in international organizations, or in government. </p>
				<p>To qualify for admission, students must have a BA with a grade point average of at least 3.5 on a 4.0 scale for the final two years of undergraduate study plus satisfactory scores on the Graduate Record Examination. </p>
				<p>To receive the master of arts in Latin American studies, a student must</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Demonstrate foreign language competence in Spanish or Portuguese. </li>
				  <li>Maintain a 3.0 GPA in thirty-six units of course work (about nine courses)
				    to be completed as follows:</li>
				 <ol class="lower-alpha"> <li>Complete the Latin American Studies Basic Seminar Sequence: twelve
				    units must be taken in the required Core Seminar in Latin American Studies
				    (LATI 200, four units), four units in approved theory seminar, and four
				    units in approved methodology seminar.</li>
				  <li>Courses must be completed in at least three fields, with no more than
				    sixteen units in any one department. Students are encouraged
				    to include four units of independent research (LATI 299) for work on
				    the master&#8217;s
				    thesis.</li>
				  <li>At least sixteen units must be taken in graduate-level courses, and
				    up to twelve units may be taken in upper-division, undergraduate-level
				    courses.</li></ol>
				  <li>Successfully complete either a comprehensive exam or master&#8217;s
				    thesis. </li>
	    </ol>
<p>MA students have the option to upgrade upper-division, undergraduate-level courses to graduate-level courses (contact the Latin American studies student affairs coordinator for information on requirements and procedures). To convert an undergraduate-level course (100 level) into a 298 graduate-level course, a student must attend all of the course meetings and incorporate a component of additional, graduate-level research work, upon arrangement with the faculty member teaching the course (a special form describing the supplementary work must be filled by the student and approved by the instructor and academic coordinator). In all such cases, the supplementary work should (a) increase the amount of reading to match the regular reading expectations of a graduate seminar, (b) include additional meeting time with the professor for a graduate-level discussion of the material, and (c) require the student to write a research paper (which would generally be on the order of fifteen to twenty pages).</p>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Disciplinary and Thematic Concentrations</h3>
				<p>MA students in Latin American studies who are interested in specific disciplines or research topics may apply for a disciplinary or thematic concentration. Currently students may choose from concentrations in cultural studies, gender studies, international migration, history, and sociology.</p>
				<p>In addition to the general requirements for all candidates applying for admission to the master of arts in Latin American studies, applicants to a concentration must submit a statement explaining their intellectual and career interests in that specific area of study. Applications from new students will be considered for the fall quarter. Current students in the Latin American studies master&#8217;s program may apply in the spring quarter of their first year.</p>
				<p>MA students who were previously enrolled as undergraduates at UC San Diego will not be allowed to repeat courses for credit toward the concentration. In all cases there are alternatives, and those students will be expected to take other classes to fulfill the requirements.</p>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">General Concentration Requirements</h3>
				<p>To receive the master of arts in Latin American studies with a concentration, a student must</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Demonstrate foreign language competence in Spanish or Portuguese.</li>
				  <li>Maintain a 3.0 GPA in forty units of course work (about ten courses)
				    to be completed as follows:</li>
				 <ol class="lower-alpha"> <li>Complete the Latin American Studies Basic Seminar Sequence: twelve
				    units must be taken in the required Core Seminar in Latin American Studies
				    (LATI 200, four units), four units in approved theory seminar, and four

				  <li>Complete sixteen units within the specifications of the concentration
				    (as specified below). All of the concentration units must be taken at
				    the graduate level (200 level), and a maximum of two undergraduate-level
				    courses (100 level) may be upgraded to graduate-level 298 courses.</li>
				  <li>Complete twelve units of general electives within the specification
				    of the concentration (as specified below). At least 50 percent of the
				    general elective units must be taken at the graduate level (200 level).</li></ol>
				  <li>Successfully complete a master&#8217;s thesis on a topic relevant
