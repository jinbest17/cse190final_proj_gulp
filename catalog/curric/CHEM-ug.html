        <h2>The Undergraduate Program </h2>

				<p>The UC San Diego Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry was founded
				  in the 1950s by the late Professor Harold Urey and a group of
				  colleagues who strove to create a department that would stress
				  the fundamentals of chemistry and, at the same time, embrace
				  diverse applications of those principles at the frontiers of knowledge. </p>
		<p>The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry offers undergraduate programs leading to the following degrees:</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>BS, Biochemistry/Chemistry</li>
				  <li>BS, Chemistry</li>
				  <li>BS, Environmental Chemistry</li>
				  <li>BS, Molecular Synthesis</li>
				  <li>BS, Pharmacological Chemistry				</li>
		</ul>
				<h3>Entry to the Majors</h3>
                <p>The degree programs in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry are open to all first-years, transfers, and continuing students. Information for new and prospective students can be found on the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry undergraduate programs website: <a href="https://chemistry.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/index.html" target="new">https://chemistry.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/index.html</a>.</p>
        <p>Students who plan to transfer to UC San Diego and major in one of the degree programs should refer to the UC San Diego undergraduate admissions website for more information on the courses required for transfer major preparation: <a href="https://admissions.ucsd.edu/transfer/transfer-major-preparation.html" target="_blank">https://admissions.ucsd.edu/transfer/transfer-major-preparation.html</a>.</p>
        <p>Either a biochemistry/chemistry major (CH31) or a chemistry major (CH25) with appropriate choice of electives provides a strong background for students intending to pursue careers in the medical sciences.</p>
        <p>Premedical students are encouraged to complete a three-quarter general chemistry series (CHEM 6A-B-C or 6AH-6BH-6CH) in their first year. Medical schools may not accept Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or A level exam scores to satisfy admissions requirements (see below). Students should complete the organic chemistry series (CHEM 40A-B-C) in their sophomore year. The lower-division biology (BILD 1-2-3) series or equivalent is also required for most medical schools, along with certain upper-division biology courses, some of which may be counted toward the major requirements in chemistry. Students should meet with one of the department&rsquo;s undergraduate advisers early in order to plan their courses and discuss their options. Career Services offers in-depth advising to premedical students:&nbsp;<a href="http://healthbeat.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">http://healthbeat.ucsd.edu/</a>.</p>
                <h3>General Major Requirements</h3>
                <h4>General Chemistry Course Sequences and Placement</h4>
                <p><strong>Basic Chemistry:</strong> CHEM 4 is a one-quarter preparation course for 6A. It includes a lab component and is to be taken by those advised to do so or those who don&rsquo;t have a strong background in chemistry.</p>
                <p><strong>General Chemistry:</strong> CHEM 6A-B-C sequence is intended for science and engineering majors as well as others who need quantitative courses. It satisfies all pre-professional program requirements.</p>
                <p><strong>Honors General Chemistry:</strong> CHEM 6AH-6BH-6CH sequence is designed for science and engineering majors with strong preparation in science and mathematics.</p>
                <p>A student intending to major in chemistry can thus begin with CHEM 4, 6A, or 6AH depending on the level of preparation. A student intending to major in a discipline other than chemistry should consult his or her adviser in the appropriate department to determine which chemistry course is recommended.</p>
                <p><strong>Advanced Placement:</strong> A score of AP3 or AP4 exempts from CHEM 4 only, and students may take CHEM 6A-B-C or CHEM 6AH-BH-CH for credit. A score of AP5 exempts from CHEM 6A-B-C, but students may take CHEM 6AH-BH-CH for credit and are encouraged to do so.</p>
        <p><strong>Chemistry for Non-Science Majors</strong>: CHEM 11, 12, 13 (The Periodic Table, Molecules and Reactions, and Chemistry of Life) is a terminal sequence for non-science/non-engineering majors. Students should check with their college advisers to determine applicability toward general-education requirements.</p>
        <h4>General Information on Undergraduate Major Requirements</h4>
                <p><strong>Residency Requirement: </strong>To receive a bachelor of science degree from UC San Diego and fulfill the campus residency requirement, all chemistry majors (including transfer students) must complete at least forty-eight or more units of upper-division chemistry course work. This course work must be taken while officially enrolled at UC San Diego.</p>
                <p><strong>Grade Requirements for Majors:</strong> The minimum GPA requirement (for both the major GPA and overall UC GPA) for graduation is 2.0. The minimum passing grade in required chemistry course work is a D, although students may not graduate with more than one D grade in upper-division required major course work and must maintain a minimum 2.0 GPA in the major. All courses for the major, except for independent research (e.g., CHEM 199) and chemistry instruction (CHEM 195), must be taken for a letter grade. These Special Studies classes are taken on a P/NP basis.</p>
                <p><strong>American Chemical Society (ACS) Certification:</strong> Students completing their degree with a major in chemistry (CH25), biochemistry/chemistry (CH31), or molecular synthesis (CH36) are automatically granted certification by the American Chemical Society. Students completing their degree with a major in environmental chemistry (CH34) or pharmacological chemistry (CH35) can receive ACS certification with the addition of one or more eligible courses (see below).</p>
                <h4>Special Studies</h4>
                <p>We strongly encourage undergraduates to participate in research, which provides hands-on experience in the laboratory under the guidance of our outstanding faculty. This experience gives you skills and knowledge that will help prepare you for graduate study or work in industry. The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry offers Special Studies courses (CHEM 196, CHEM 197, CHEM 99/199) in which students can earn academic credit for conducting independent research with a faculty or industry mentor.  </p>

        <h3>Major Summary</h3>
        <p>The biochemistry/chemistry major deals with the chemical processes in living organisms, including structure and function of nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids. It is suitable for those planning to go to graduate school or to medical, dental, veterinary, or other professional schools. It is also suitable at the bachelor’s level for jobs in the biotechnology or pharmaceutical field. Note the requirement for two advanced elective courses in biochemistry. If one does not wish to take so much biochemistry, one should major in chemistry and use electives to take the desired number of biochemistry courses. &nbsp;</p>

                <h3>Major Summary</h3>
                <p>The pharmacological chemistry major provides a strong background in chemistry. The major is intended primarily to prepare students for pharmacy school (PharmD). As for any professional school, students will need to supplement this program with other courses to meet all entrance requirements. Many pharmacy schools require a course in Economics (usually Econ 1 or 3) and a course in public speaking. Many pharmacy schools also require a year of biology with lab. Students may elect an upper-division biology lab or they may consult with pharmacy schools as to their requirements. Students fulfilling their elective requirements with appropriate courses should be prepared for graduate school in biochemistry or other areas of science. Degree recipients would also be prepared for jobs in the biotechnology and chemical industries. </p>
				<p>Advanced Placement: Pharmacological chemistry students are encouraged to complete a full year of general chemistry and a full year of lower-division biology. Some pharmacy programs may not accept tests such as the Advanced Placement exam to satisfy these requirements. </p>

                <p>A minor in chemistry consists of three lower-division lecture courses, followed by a minimum of four upper-division courses, including at least one laboratory course. Lower-division course requirements may not be satisfied by advanced placement credit, although transfer units may be used to satisfy lower-division minor requirements. </p>
                <p>Students may apply two upper-division chemistry courses required by their major toward the minor. Students who wish to minor in chemistry should have their course work plans approved in advance by the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry Student Affairs Office. Upper-division courses for the minor must be taken at UC San Diego in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, and must be taken for a letter grade. The minimum overall GPA requirement for the minor is 2.0. </p>
                <p>Chemistry and biochemistry minors can include a range of upper-division courses across different discipline areas of chemistry such as organic, biochemistry, inorganic, physical, pharmacological, and environmental.
