<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">The Joint Doctoral Program </h2>
				<p>San Diego State University (SDSU) and the University of California San Diego (UC San Diego), offer jointly a doctoral program in Language and Communicative Disorders. The program&#8217;s
				  focus is the interdisciplinary study of language and communicative disorders.
				  A major emphasis of the program is to apply techniques developed in cognitive
				  science and neuroscience to the study of language and language disorders.
				  The program involves study and research in normal language (including sign
				  languages of the deaf and language impairments), and in the neural bases
				  of language use and language loss. Participating faculty have research
				  interests in a wide range of issues in processes of language development,
				  language and aging, multilingualism, language disorders, assessment, and
				  intervention. Graduates of the program will be qualified to serve as faculty
				  in university programs in a variety of disciplines, and to provide leadership
				  in research and health services. The doctoral program faculty at UC San Diego are an interdisciplinary group from the Departments of Cognitive Science, Communication, Linguistics, Neurosciences, Radiology, Psychiatry, and Psychology. The doctoral program faculty at SDSU are members of the School of Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences and the Departments of Linguistics and Psychology. The program is coordinated by the doctoral program coordinators at each campus, in conjunction with an Executive Committee comprising three faculty from each campus appointed by the Graduate Deans from each campus.  </p>
<p>The program is innovative in that many of the requirements are designed to function as a model of professional preparation specifically incorporating activities in which a successful teacher and researcher must engage after obtaining the PhD: students will be required to participate in interdisciplinary research throughout the program, learn about the nature and ethics of research, prepare grant proposals, write manuscripts, and will gain experience in oral presentations and teaching. Graduates from the program will be well prepared for the rigors of an academic/research career. The doctoral program in Language and Communicative Disorders, being interdisciplinary, draws from a variety of undergraduate disciplines, including communicative disorders, psychology, cognitive science, linguistics, neurosciences, engineering, and other related sciences. Students should have adequate preparation in mathematics, statistics, and biological sciences. Background in neurosciences and/or language sciences, or language disorders is helpful, but not required for admission. </p>
				<p>By the end of the first year, all students will select a major field of emphasis by choosing one of three concentrations. The <em>Adult Language</em> concentration is intended to provide intensive education in communicative disorders in adults. Students in this concentration will also develop expertise in the study of language processing in normal adults. The <em>Child Language</em> concentration is intended to provide specialized education in childhood (birth to adolescence) communicative disorders. Students in this concentration will also achieve competence in developmental psycholinguistics emphasizing language acquisition in normally developing children. The <em>Multilingualism</em> concentration is intended to provide education in cross-linguistic, ethnographic, and other comparative studies of communicative disorders in children and/or adults, including those associated with bilingualism and second-language acquisition (including acquisition of sign language in deaf individuals). All students will be required to take some courses in each of the three concentrations. In addition, each student will elect a <em>methods minor</em>, applying one of the new technologies of cognitive neuroscience to research on language and communicative disorders. These may include computer-controlled studies of language and cognitive processing in real-time, functional brain imaging (including event-related brain potentials and/or functional magnetic resonance imaging), or neural-network simulations of communicative disorders.  </p>
				<p>The program is designed as a five-year curriculum, based on a twelve-month academic year. Students will be admitted to the doctoral program only in the fall semester/quarter. Information regarding admission is found in the current edition of the <span class="italic">Graduate Bulletin</span> of San Diego State University. To obtain admission application and program information, contact: SDSU/UC San Diego Joint Doctoral Program in Language and Communicative Disorders, San Diego State University, 5500 Campanile Drive, <a href="http://slhs.sdsu.edu/phd/" target="_blank">http://slhs.sdsu.edu/phd/</a>. </p>
				<h3>Program of Study</h3>
				<p>Required courses include the <em>Tools</em> requirement (two courses in statistics/research design, a course in neuroanatomy and physiology, a course in language structure and theory and a professional survival skills course), the <em>Foundations</em> requirement (two courses on normal language and three courses on disorders of language) and the <em>Electives</em> requirement (at least four courses, with a minimum of three courses related to the chosen concentration, chosen from a broad list of approved options from the Departments of Cognitive Science, Communication, Computer Science, Linguistics, Neurosciences, and Psychology). Consult with an adviser for an approved list of elective courses. The four required electives must be approved by the student’s adviser and the doctoral program coordinators. In addition to their course requirements, students are required to complete two laboratory rotations in different research methodologies (each lasting a minimum of one quarter), two research projects (first year and second year), a qualifying examination for advancement to candidacy, and a dissertation proposal in the form of grant proposal to one of the public agencies that funds research in communicative disorders. </p>
