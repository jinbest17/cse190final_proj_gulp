<p><em>All courses, faculty listings, and curricular and degree requirements described herein are subject to change or deletion without notice. </em></p>
<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p>Undergraduate courses offered in the Department of Music satisfy a wide range of interests for non-music majors as well as for students majoring in music. Students wishing to acquire a musical background to support further study should take MUS 1A-B-C, which develops skills musicians use in the analysis and performance of music. Students interested in &ldquo;music appreciation&rdquo; should choose from the following courses that introduce aspects of the rich heritage of music: MUS 4–18. None of these courses has prerequisites. Students with prior musical background who wish to continue in upper-division theory courses should take MUS 2A-B-C in lieu of MUS 1A-B-C.</p>
  <h2 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Music, Music Humanities, and ICAM Major Programs </h2>
				<p>The undergraduate program at UC San Diego offers a bachelor of arts in music, music humanities, and ICAM (Interdisciplinary Computing and the Arts). The curriculum emphasizes the development of musical listening and performance skills as applied to both contemporary and traditional music.				</p>
				<p>The music major is intended for students who may choose to engage in music as a profession. This major thus requires extensive development of musical skills. A student without the appropriate level of those skills upon entrance to UC San Diego must devote considerable time to attaining them, either in lower-division courses or independent study. </p>
				<p>The music/humanities major is intended for students who wish to pursue a broad liberal arts program that includes music as a central element. This program emphasizes music history and literature, and allows the individual student to select an area of interest for the major within the broad field of the humanities. </p>
				<p>The interdisciplinary computing and the arts major is intended for students who wish to pursue the field of music specializing in the art and technology of our time. Below is a detailed description of this major.</p>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Music Major Requirements </h3>
				<p>The lower-division prerequisites for the music major are MUS 2A-B-C, and MUS 2AK-BK-CK. Jazz emphasis students take MUS 2JK in lieu of 2CK. To continue within the major, all students must pass Music 2C or an equivalent proficiency exam. Composition emphasis students must take Music 33A-B-C, Introduction to Composition I, II, and III, or take a proficiency exam for the three-quarter sequence course. All required music major courses must be taken for a letter grade, with the exception of MUS 143, which is taken on a Pass/Not Pass basis. All courses to be counted toward satisfying the major requirements must be passed with a grade of C or better. </p>

				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Interdisciplinary Computing and the Arts (ICAM) Major Requirements				</h3>
				<p>The goals of the ICAM program are to</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="list-level-1">prepare the next generation of artists who will be functioning in a computer-mediated culture</li>
					<li class="list-level-1">give students necessary technical, theoretical, and historical backgrounds so they can contribute to the development of new aesthetics for computer media</li>
					<li class="list-level-1">prepare students to mediate between the worlds of computer science and technology, the arts, and the culture at large by being equally proficient with computing and cultural concepts</li>
					<li class="list-level-1">give students sufficient understanding of the trajectories of development in computing so they can anticipate and work with the emerging trends, rather than being locked in particular software currently available on the market.				</li>

				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Recommendations for Transfer Students</h4>
				<p>Students who plan to transfer into the music major should have strong skills in basic musicianship. For those planning to emphasize performance, solid proficiency on the instrument is required. A general course in the history of music is recommended. All transfer students must pass a proficiency examination in MUS 2C. Basic Musicianship, and MUS 2CK. Basic Keyboard, or take the two sequence courses. To verify the acceptability of transfer music courses, students must make an appointment with the undergraduate staff adviser. </p>
				<p>To major in ICAM, transfer students should attempt to complete the following lower-division courses before transferring to UC San Diego: CSE 11 (or CSE 8A/8AL/8B), Math 20A-B (or Math 10A-B-C), MUS 4, and if available, courses equivalent to MUS 1A, 6, and/or 14. </p>
				<p>ASSIST (<a href="http://assist.org" target="_blank">http://assist.org</a>) is an online student-transfer information system that shows how course credits earned at one public California college or university can be applied when transferred to another. ASSIST is the official repository of articulation for California&rsquo;s public colleges and universities and provides the most accurate and up-to-date information about student transfer in California.</p>
				<p>While some transferrable courses may be listed on ASSIST, transfers should be prepared to provide course descriptions, syllabi, and/or other materials that may be required to determine the content of the courses taken at other institutions.</p>
                <h3>Music Department Honors </h3>
                <h4>Application Eligibility and Process</h4>

Technology, literature emphasis, and music humanities major students will give a presentation in spring quarter of their senior year at the Department Seminar (MUS 43). The student&rsquo;s faculty sponsor will make a recommendation of whether or not Honors with Distinction, with High Distinction, or with Highest Distinction will be posted on the student&rsquo;s final transcript.</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> Being admitted to the Honors curriculum does not guarantee that a student will be recommended for an honors designation on their transcript. The faculty sponsor will make a final assessment after all performances, papers, or presentations are complete.				</p>
