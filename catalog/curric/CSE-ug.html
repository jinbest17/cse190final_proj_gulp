		<h4>Computer Science and Engineering Undergraduate Admissions</h4>
		<p>Because of the large number of students interested in computer science undergraduate programs, and the limited resources available to accommodate this demand, the university has declared all majors in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering as &ldquo;capped&rdquo;: BA computer science, BS computer science, BS computer engineering, and BS computer science with specialization in bioinformatics.</p>
		<p>Admission directly into one of CSE&rsquo;s capped majors is limited for freshmen, effective fall 2013. Students will be selected by the UC San Diego Office of Undergraduate Admissions based on the students&rsquo; holistic review scores and availability of slots in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. All potential freshmen must indicate on the UC application if they wish to major in computer science or computer engineering.</p>
		<p>Admission directly into one of CSE&rsquo;s capped majors is limited for transfer students, effective fall 2015. New transfer students will be selected by the UC San Diego Office of Undergraduate Admissions based on the students&rsquo; holistic review scores and availability of slots in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. All potential transfer students must indicate on the UC application if they wish to major in computer science or computer engineering.</p>
		<p>Admission to CSE&rsquo;s capped majors is limited for all continuing UC San Diego students, effective fall 2015.  </p>
<h4>Continuing Students</h4>
		<p>UC San Diego students who wish to change from another major into one of CSE&rsquo;s capped majors may apply to the Department of Computer Science and Engineering for admission into the BA computer science, BS computer science, BS computer engineering, or BS computer science with specialization in bioinformatics major. </p>
<h5>Eligibility requirements: </h5>
        <ol start="1" type="1">
          <li>Minimum of eight&nbsp;units of courses      completed at UC San Diego for a letter grade, drawn from the following      screening courses: CSE 8B or CSE 11, CSE 12, CSE 15L, CSE 20, CSE 21, CSE 30, and CSE      100.</li>
          <li>All of the following eligibility courses (or their      accepted equivalent) must have been completed prior to application: CSE 8B      or 11, CSE 12, CSE 15L, and CSE 20.</li>
          <li>Students      must receive a 3.3 GPA in screening courses taken at UC San Diego. </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h5>Application process:</h5>
        <p>Students may apply in any quarter after they have completed the above eligibility requirements. Students who meet the 3.3 GPA cutoff for screening courses will be entered into a lottery. Students will be randomly selected until the open number of seats in CSE are filled. Students may apply for the lottery a maximum of two times throughout their entire education at UC San Diego. </p>
        <h5>Transfer Student Preparation for Success</h5>
        <p>To reduce the amount of time needed to complete degree requirements, transfer students should complete as many prerequisite courses as possible before starting at UC San Diego. A 3.0 GPA in these courses is recommended.        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Calculus I—for Science and Engineering (MATH 20A)</li>
          <li>Calculus II—for Science and Engineering (MATH 20B)</li>
          <li>Calculus and Analytic Geometry (MATH 20C)</li>
          <li>Differential Equations (MATH 20D)—required for BS computer engineering only</li>
          <li>Linear Algebra (MATH 18)</li>
          <li>Complete      calculus-based physics series (PHYS 2A-B-C)—required for BS computer      engineering only </li>
      
          <li>Highest level of introductory computer programming language (i.e. Java, C or C++) course offerings at the community college</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Degree and Program Options </h4>
				<p>The Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) offers four degree programs: the BS degree in computer science, the BA degree in computer science, the BS degree in computer engineering, and the BS degree in computer science with a specialization in bioinformatics. All major requirements for each degree program must be completed with a C– or better, except for courses offered Pass/No Pass only.</p>
				<p>All CSE programs of study provide a broad and rigorous curriculum and are designed to provide students with the strong academic education and technical training necessary for placement in the competitive high-tech job market as well as for advanced studies in graduate school.</p>
				<p>The CSE department encourages students to explore opportunities outside the classroom. Students may apply to be tutors and readers in CSE courses, which are excellent opportunities to interact more closely with faculty and gain communication and training skills. Independent research is recommended, and CSE students participate in research projects with graduate students and faculty from CSE, the San Diego Supercomputer Center, Calit2&rsquo;s Qualcomm Institute, and other departments across campus. The department has strong ties with the local and national high-tech industry, where students can earn course credit through internship positions that allow them to apply their academic knowledge toward exciting commercial technologies. </p>
				<p>Please note that DS25 majors may not double major in any CSE major, nor may they minor in CSE.</p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">BS Computer Science Program </h3>
				<p>The lower-division course requirements are designed to provide a strong foundation in mathematics, physics, programming methodology and skills, and computer organization. Upper-division core courses deal with the theory and design of algorithms, hardware, and software. Electives allow students to gain additional breadth and/or depth in computer science and engineering.</p>
				<p>Recommended high school preparation includes mathematics courses so that students can take freshman calculus in their first quarter. Courses in high school physics and computer programming are helpful preparation but are not required.</p>
                <p>The BS in computer science requires a total of 124 units for the BS computer science program (not including the general-education requirements).</p>

                <p>The CSE Honors Program encourages eligible undergraduate students
                  to perform advanced study in their major. Students in the honors
                  program work closely with faculty on an undergraduate research
                  project, typically completed over two quarters. As a result,
                  the honors program is excellent preparation for further study
                  in a graduate program. Students who complete the honors program
                  also have an honors distinction officially bestowed upon them
                  upon graduation.</p>
                <p>The CSE Honors Program does not increase the units required for graduation in a CSE major. Students participating in the Honors Program may apply eight units in CSE 199H for the equivalent of two elective courses for their major. Students may also apply unit credit in CSE 199H toward the cluster requirement in the undergraduate program. Please note that CSE 199H does count toward the special studies limit of twelve units.</p>
