                <h3>The Accounting Minor</h3>
                <p>The Rady School of Management’s accounting minor is designed
                  to provide students a breadth of understanding of accounting
                  theory, practices, and applications. The minor will appeal
                  to students who envision careers in the accounting profession.
                  Because of accounting’s broad application, these careers would
                  span across public accounting firms, corporate accounting departments,
                  and governmental, nonprofit, and nongovernmental organizations.
                  For many students, this will be their first step in achieving
                  a Certificate in Public Accounting, CPA.</p>
                <h4 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Accounting Minor Requirements</h4>
                <p>The accounting minor will consist of seven courses that cover
                  the key accounting principles, processes, and applications.
                  Required courses include two lower-division courses and five
                  upper-division courses.</p>
                <h5>Lower-Division Courses</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>MGT 4. Financial Accounting or Econ 4. Financial Accounting</li>
                  <li>MGT 5. Managerial Accounting</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Upper-Division Courses</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>MGT 131A. Intermediate Accounting A</li>
                  <li>MGT 131B. Intermediate Accounting B</li>
                  <li>MGT 132. Auditing</li>
                  <li>MGT 135. Federal Taxation—Companies</li>
                  <li>MGT 136. Advanced Accounting</li>
                </ul>
        <p>In order to count toward the minor, all courses must be taken
                  for a letter grade and students must earn a C– or better in
                  each course. Lower-division transfer credits for courses that
                  are clearly equivalent in scope and content to lower-division
                  courses required for the accounting minor will be accepted
                  from regionally accredited United States institutions and from
                  foreign institutions recognized by the Rady School of Management.</p>
                <h5>CPA Accounting Requirements</h5>
                <p>A student who completes nine Rady accounting courses (the seven courses required for the minor plus two electives) will have met part of the accounting educational requirement for CPA licensure—thirty-six quarter units in accounting subjects. The CPA education requirements changed effective January 1 2014, and include additional educational requirements.

<h3>The Business Minor</h3>
                <p>The Rady School of Management&rsquo;s business minor is designed to provide students the breadth of understanding of business theory and a depth of ability with business practices and applications. This minor will appeal to students who envision careers that require an understanding of the basic principles and practices of business. Because of business&rsquo;s broad application, UC San Diego students with a minor in business will be well prepared to assume entry and intermediate positions in the business functions of a vast number large and small for-profit companies, governmental agencies, nonprofit organizations, and nongovernmental entities. Additionally, graduates pursuing careers not directly related to formal business functions, but still impacted by business practices, will bring a much-valued perspective to their initial employment.</p>

                <p>To fulfill the requirements of the business minor, students must take five required courses (twenty units) and two electives (or the equivalent of eight units). A maximum of two lower-division courses may be applied toward the minor.   The required courses are</p>
