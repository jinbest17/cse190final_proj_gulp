<p><em>All courses, faculty listings, and curricular and degree requirements described herein are subject to change or deletion without notice. </em></p>
<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p>Chinese Studies is an interdisciplinary program that allows the student interested
  in China to utilize the university’s offerings in various departments to build
  a major leading to a bachelor’s degree. In addition to coordinating courses in the
  various departments, the Program in Chinese Studies offers courses directly
  under its own auspices to round out the available offerings.</p>
<p>The Chinese Studies Program combines historical understanding with an emphasis on modern and contemporary China. The Department of History has a strong specialization in late imperial and modern China. A full spectrum of courses on the politics, economics, society, and culture of today&rsquo;s China are offered via other departments at UC San Diego. Another focal point of research interest is visual culture and cultural history in modern and premodern China. The interdisciplinary nature of the program (see departmental affiliation of the participating faculty) can accommodate students of a wide range of interests. In addition to our local resources, the University of California Education Abroad Program (EAP) and Opportunities Abroad Program (OAP) are affiliated with various universities and language institutes in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore. This, together with other academic exchange programs with a number of Chinese universities, provides the possibility of a junior year abroad, to take both Mandarin Chinese courses and nonlanguage courses dealing with various aspects of Chinese studies. Such courses are subject to final approval by the program director of an Undergraduate Student Petition upon completion of the course(s). Please note that at least six of the upper-division courses for the major must be taken at UC San Diego. </p>
<h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">The Major Program </h2>
				<p>The student choosing a major in Chinese studies must meet the following
				  requirements: </p>
				<ol>
                  <li>Two years of Mandarin Chinese (CHIN 10 A-B-C and 20 A-B-C
                    or equivalent) or equivalent Chinese language knowledge.</li>
                  <li>Twelve upper-division four-unit courses in Chinese studies
                    topics.</li>
                  <ul type="circle">
                    <li>Courses must be taken from at least three different departments
                      or programs.</li>
                    
                        <li>Three       of the twelve courses must be upper-division Chinese history.</li>
                    
                 
                    <li>One       of those courses is required to be a four-unit seminar or colloquium in       which students are expected to write a substantial term paper. Typically,       the Department of History offers at least one colloquium per academic       year, which are usually numbered HIEA 161–171. The student will need to       request and receive permission from the professor and the Department of       History before enrolling in such a course. The colloquium must be completed       at UC San Diego.</li>
                    
                    <li>No more than six of those upper-division courses may be Chinese language acquisition courses.</li>
                    <li>A minimum of six upper-division courses must be taken
                      at UC San Diego. </li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>As a rule, all courses must be taken and completed for
                    a letter grade for both the major and minor. Exceptions are
                    granted for CHIN 198 and CHIN 199. </li>
		</ol>
<p>In principle, the courses that the Chinese Studies Program accepts are lower- and upper-division courses that study China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, or Mandarin Chinese. Only six upper-division courses may be taken abroad (or at another institution) and only three of those may be Chinese language acquisition courses. All courses not taken at UC San Diego must be reviewed and approved as compatible with the Program in Chinese Studies guidelines via a Student Petition upon returning from EAP, OAP, or from another US academic institution. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the Chinese Studies Program, a majority of the courses listed below are planned by participating departments or programs for the current academic year. </p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Honors Program </h3>
				<p>Minimum requirements for admission to the program are </p>
				<ol>
                  <li>Junior standing </li>
                  <li>A GPA of 3.5 or better in the major </li>
                  <li>Overall GPA of 3.2 or better </li>
                  <li>Recommendation      of a faculty sponsor who is familiar with the student’s work </li>
                    <li>Completion      of at least four approved upper-division courses approved by the Chinese      Studies Program </li>
                    <li>Completion      of at least one year of Chinese language study or equivalent knowledge                </li></ol>
<p>Students who qualify for honors must consult with a faculty mentor; submit a proposal; complete the appropriate form(s); enroll, complete, and pass a two-quarter sequence of directed study during which they define a research project; carry out the research; and complete a senior thesis. </p>
<p>The completed thesis will be evaluated by a committee consisting of the student’s thesis adviser and one other faculty member appointed by the Chinese Studies Program director. </p>
<h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">The Minor Program </h2>
				<p>A minor in Chinese studies consists of at least three lower-division courses (a minimum of twelve units) and four upper-division courses (a minimum of sixteen units) for students who place into lower-division courses. Students who place into upper-division Chinese language courses or can demonstrate native fluency may complete the minor, Chinese Studies, with seven upper-division courses (a minimum of twenty-eight units). Students who wish to declare the minor but do not wish to pursue language study may also complete the minor with seven upper-division courses. Each course must be taken for a letter grade. The seven courses must be selected from across three different departments or programs. No more than four Chinese language courses may be applied toward the minor. For students wishing to apply courses taken abroad to the minor, certain restrictions do apply. Please consult with the program coordinator regarding the following: the student petition process, the minimum four-unit requirement for each course taken abroad, which type of courses qualify, and what combination is applicable for each particular student. </p>
<h2>Courses
				  Applicable for the Chinese Studies Major and/or Minor Offered
				  by Various Departments and Programs </h2>
<p>For description of courses listed below, see appropriate departmental listing. All graduate-level courses require consent of the instructor/department for undergraduate students. Some departmental offerings have content that varies from year to year. In those cases, Chinese Studies Program approval via student petition is given only when content relates primarily to China. </p>
