<p>Global health is at once an increasingly popular new field of study, an urgent social concern, and a powerful interdisciplinary intellectual synthesis aimed at understanding and productively intervening in processes of health, illness, and healing across the globe.&nbsp;Two senses of the term <em>global</em> structure the program&rsquo;s curriculum: The first defines a geographical space that is planetary and international; the second is an intellectual scope that is holistic and interdisciplinary. Undergraduate degrees in the Global Health Program (BA and minor) are designed to provide students with an in-depth understanding of factors related to illness, health, and healing from a comparative and interdisciplinary perspective that transcends national borders and regional interests and takes cultural difference and cross-cultural diversity fully into account. Global health is directly concerned with achieving equity in health for people worldwide. It is a synthesis of population-based prevention, individual-level clinical care, health policy and program development, and cross-cultural understanding of variations and commonalities in the experiences with and causes of illness, the process of becoming and staying well, and the practices of healing.  </p>
<p>The Global Health Program covers a wide range of topics, including health care, health education, environmental effects on health, infectious disease, mental health, health inequalities, medical sequelae of natural disaster or political violence, indigenous healing practices, nutrition, and reproductive health.&nbsp;The program&rsquo;s degrees are designed to be intellectually comprehensive, integrating the social sciences, biological sciences, and humanities. In addition, they combine academic and experiential learning, as well as strike a pedagogical balance between the acquisition of hard skills, theory, and real-world knowledge. An important feature of the program is a Global Health Field Experience at a research, service, or clinical site either in the United States or abroad. This program of study helps to prepare students for a career in research and teaching, immigrant service-providing organizations, government agencies, health sciences, or law. The unique research and writing opportunities offered by this minor also make it an excellent preparation for medical and graduate school. </p>
<h3>Horizons Honors Thesis Program</h3>
<p>During spring quarter of a student&rsquo;s junior year, global health majors may apply to be a part of the two-quarter honors thesis seminar, open only to global health majors in the BA and BS. The seminar will reflect the unique resources of UC San Diego&rsquo;s college system by treating the relation between global health and each of the themes highlighted by the colleges: international relations, environmentalism, law/ethics, technology, humanities, and public service. The seminar will also provide an opportunity to expand, deepen, and share the insights of their Global Health Field Experience with members of their cohort.</p>
<p>The first quarter will consist of intensive reading and discussion in fields related to each student&rsquo;s primary interest and building on their field experience. The second quarter will be a workshop with critical input from all participants focused on preparing a senior thesis that will provide an important credential for students in the next stage of their careers and as they prepare applications for graduate academic or professional training. The Horizons of Global Health capstone conference, held annually in the spring quarter, will assemble all global health majors and minors and be open to the campus community. The conference features a guest speaker with a distinguished reputation in global health along with presentations of theses by graduating participants.</p>

<p>The Global Health Field Experience project will be carried out at a research, service, or clinical site either in the United States or abroad. Field Experience will be approved by the advisory committee, along with the Study Abroad UC San Diego office (for international placements) and Academic Internship Program (for domestic placements). The project will focus on issues relevant to global health, including health care, health education, environmental effects on health, infectious disease, mental health, health disparities, medical sequelae of natural disaster or political violence, indigenous healing practices, nutrition, and reproductive health. In accord with the campus&rsquo;s Education Initiative, the Global Health Field Experience will enhance knowledge, skills, and sensitivities, thus engaging &ldquo;mind, hands, and heart&rdquo; to create a learning outcome that is scientific, pragmatic, and humanistic.</p>
<h5>Field Experience Requirements</h5>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Minimum      one hundred hours distributed over no more than three programs</li>
  <li>May be      completed domestically or abroad (upon approval)</li>
  <li>May be      noncredit or credit bearing (see below)</li>
</ul>
<h5>The Field Experience must meet the following criteria:</h5>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Require      meaningful, challenging work from students while serving the agency&rsquo;s      clients/goals.</li>
  <li>Provide      the student with direct contact with clients or those who directly serve      clients.</li>

      <h2>The Global Health Minor (seven courses/twenty-eight units)</h2>
<p>The Global Health minor covers a wide range of topics relevant to global health including health care, health education, environmental effects on health, infectious disease, mental health, health inequalities, medical sequelae of natural disaster or political violence, indigenous healing practices, nutrition, and reproductive health. This program of study helps to prepare students for a career in research and teaching, immigrant service-providing organizations, government agencies, health sciences, or law. The unique research and writing opportunities offered by this minor also make it an excellent preparation for medical and graduate school. </p>
<p>The minor consists of a total of seven courses (twenty-eight units), at least five of which must be upper-division courses. All courses applied to the minor must receive a letter grade of C– or better.</p>
<h3>I. Required Core Courses (three courses/twelve units)</h3>

    <h3>IV. Global Health Minor Field Experience <em>(Optional)</em></h3>
    <p>Global Health minors may choose to complete a 100-hour Global Health Field Experience requirement to complement their course work. </p>
    <p>The Field Experience project will be carried out at a research, service, or clinical site either in the United States or abroad. Field Experience will be approved by the advisory committee, along with the Study Abroad UC San Diego office (for international placements) and Academic Internship Program (for domestic placements). The project will focus on issues relevant to global health, including health care, health education, environmental effects on health, infectious disease, mental health, health disparities, medical sequelae of natural disaster or political violence, indigenous healing practices, nutrition, and reproductive health. In accord with the campus&rsquo;s Education Initiative, the Global Health Field Experience component will enhance knowledge, skills, and sensitivities, thus engaging &ldquo;mind, hands, and heart&rdquo; to create a learning outcome that is scientific, pragmatic, and humanistic.</p>
    <h4>Field Experience Requirement</h4>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Minimum      one hundred hours distributed over no more than three programs </li>
      <li>May be      completed domestically or abroad, upon approval</li>
      <li>May be      noncredit or credit-bearing (see below)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>The Field Experience must meet the following criteria:</strong></p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Require      meaningful, challenging work from students while serving the agency&rsquo;s      clients/goals.</li>
      <li>Provide      the student with direct contact with clients or those who directly serve      clients.</li>
      <li>Provide      the student with an opportunity to become knowledgeable about aspects of      global health and see global health issues in practice.</li>
      <li>Include      on-site orientation, training, and supervision by a designated person in      the agency. </li>
      <li>Students      must demonstrate adequate health insurance and participate in a      predeparture orientation for abroad programs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Credit-bearing field experience: </strong>Upon approval by petition, a student may enroll in a maximum of two Independent Study (GLBH 199) or Directed Group Study (GLBH 198) courses under mentorship of an affiliated faculty member. This will provide academic credit for the noncredit-bearing field experience through required readings, reflective journals, papers, etc., as determined by agreement between the student and faculty member. The academic result will be to place their field experience in the context of the interdisciplinary scholarly literature on global health. When credit is granted either through the program itself or through our GLBH Independent Study/Directed Group study, this credit will count as an elective toward the minor. </p>
