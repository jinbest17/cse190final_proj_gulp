				  following receipt of the BS. Students interested in
				  applying to this program should meet with the BS/MS adviser
				  in the Biology Student and Instructional Services Office <em>before</em> the
			    end of their junior year. </p>
<p>The program is open only to UC San Diego Biological Sciences undergraduates. The Division of Biological Sciences does not have financial aid available for students enrolled in this program. Students participating in the master&rsquo;s program may apply to serve as an instructional assistant. For details, deadlines, and other information, please visit the <a href="http://biology.ucsd.edu/education/undergrad/student-opp/instructional-asst/" target="_blank">biological sciences instructional assistants web page</a>. </p>
<div>
  <div> </div>
</div>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Eligibility and Enrollment</h3>
				<p>To be eligible, students must have completed the first two quarters of their junior year in residence at UC San Diego and must have an overall UC GPA of at least 3.0. Students&#8217; major GPA should be at least 3.3. Students must demonstrate excellent performance in upper-division biology core courses during their undergraduate program to be eligible to enroll in biology graduate core courses. </p>
				<p>It is the responsibility of the prospective BS/MS student to select
				  a faculty member who would be
				  willing to serve as the student’s adviser and in whose laboratory the student
				  would complete at least twenty-four units of research over a two-year period.
				  The units of research that must be completed during the student’s senior
				  undergraduate year must be taken <em>in addition</em> to the requirements
				  for the bachelor’s degree. These units will count toward the requirements
				  for the master’s degree only. Students must complete six consecutive quarters
				  of research to fulfill the research component of the program. Any deviation
				  from this plan, such as a break in enrollment for one or more quarters,
			    will be cause for the student to be dropped from the program. </p>
                <p>Students who have been approved (by both the Division of Biological
                  Sciences and the UC San Diego Office of Graduate Admissions) for the
                  program must enroll in a Special Studies Course, BISP 193 or BISP 199 (senior
                  year) and BGGN 271 (graduate year only), for each and every
                  quarter of participation in the BS/MS program. Students
                  can obtain the appropriate course code and departmental authorization at
                  the Biology Student and Instructional Services Office. </p>
<p>Research work (BGGN 271) will be credited toward the BS/MS program requirements only if it is completed during the time a student is officially enrolled at UC San Diego and has paid tuition for that quarter. </p>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Requirements for the Master of Science</h3>
				<ol>
					<li> Completion of six consecutive quarters of research with the same mentor during the senior
					  undergraduate year and the graduate period. </li>
					<li> Completion of at least thirty-six units of graduate course work (BGGN
					  200-level or higher, or approved [via petition] graduate courses offered
					  by related departments at a similar level) during the graduate year. The
					  course of study must be approved by the faculty adviser. </li>
					<li> Twelve of the thirty-six units must be in courses other than BGGN 271.
					  (BGGN 297 and BGGN 299 may not be used to satisfy this requirement.) </li>
					<li> Maintenance of a grade point average (both overall and in the major)
					  of at least 3.0 for all course work, both cumulatively and for each quarter
					  of enrollment in the BS/MS program. If the student&#8217;s GPA falls
					  below 3.0 (for either overall or in the major), he or she will be automatically
				    dropped from the program. </li>
				    <li>Completion      of a thesis, with an oral presentation to, and approval of, a three-member      thesis committee. The research adviser and thesis committee chair must be      a ladder rank or adjunct faculty member in the Division of Biological      Sciences, except in cases where the research project has an educational      theme (initiated via enrollment in BISP 193), where the adviser and      committee chair may be a teaching professor in the Division of Biological      Sciences who has been approved for this role by the Academic Senate. The      thesis committee must contain at least two Academic Senate faculty from      the Division of Biological Sciences; no more than one adjunct faculty can      serve on the committee. If an adjunct faculty serves as chair of the      thesis committee, one of the biology faculty members must serve as cochair. </li>
	
                  <li>At least three complete, separate, and consecutive quarters of residency
                    as a graduate student that will commence the quarter
                    immediately following the quarter in which the BS is awarded.
                    (Note: The
                    summer session is not considered an official quarter
                    during the graduate year.) </li>
                  <li>Students who have been approved for the BS/MS program
                    must provide the Office of Graduate Admissions with a
                    copy of their official UC San Diego transcripts with the BS
                    posted, prior to the commencement of the graduate
                  year in the program.				</li>
				</ol>
				<p class="anchor-parent"><a class="anchor" id="doctoral"></a></p><h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">The Doctoral Program</h2>
				<p>Graduate studies for a PhD in the Division of Biological Sciences in affiliation with the Salk Institute for Biological Studies are oriented mainly toward the development of the capacity for independent research and for teaching in the biological sciences. </p>
				<p>The requirements for entrance to graduate study in the Division of Biological Sciences are flexible, but a strong background in mathematics, chemistry, and physics is recommended. </p>
				<p>Formal course work and opportunities for dissertation research include most basic areas of experimental biology, with emphasis in the general areas of biochemistry, biophysics, cancer biology, cell biology, conservation, developmental biology, ecology, behavior, and evolution, genetics, immunology, molecular biology, neurobiology, plant molecular biology, plant systems biology, quantitative biology, signal transduction, systems biology, and virology.</p>
<p>During the first year of graduate study, each student undertakes a research project in the laboratory of each of four to six different faculty members and is expected to spend a major portion of his or her academic time on this project. The laboratories are selected by the student in consultation with the first-year adviser to provide a broad view of the research interests of the division. The student is also expected to enroll in the first-year graduate biology sequence, which includes a &ldquo;boot camp&rdquo; that helps develop fundamental lab skills in biology, as well as courses on bioinformatics, biostatistics, and methods and logic in biological sciences. Students are also required to complete course and practicum requirements as part of the Graduate Instructional Apprentice program. Development of teaching skills is a key goal for students in our doctoral program. Students will serve three times as an instructional assistant (IA) and enroll in a course on teaching and mentoring. This course has an in-class component led by a faculty member with expertise in evidence-based teaching methods, and an apprentice-teaching component supervised by a biology course instructor. Doctoral students must receive a satisfactory evaluation from all instructors in whose courses they serve as IAs. This part of our program aims to prepare doctoral students for future careers that involve teaching and mentoring. </p>
<p>A program
  of further study, including seminars and courses appropriate to a student’s
  background and interests, is arranged through consultation between the
  student and the faculty. Much reliance is placed on informal instruction
  through early and close association of the student with the faculty and
  research staff, and through regular seminars. After becoming familiar with
  the research activities of the faculty through the laboratory rotation
  program, the student begins work on a thesis research problem of his or
  her choice no later than the end of the first year. The student is free
  to choose, for the thesis adviser, a regular member of the UC San Diego faculty or
  an adjunct member of the Division of Biological Sciences faculty. The student
  is required to have completed a two-part examination in order to be admitted
  to candidacy for the PhD. The purpose of the examinations is for
  the student to demonstrate competence in the field of major interest and
  in related fields of biology. The major remaining requirement for the PhD is the satisfactory completion of a dissertation consisting of original
  research carried out under the guidance of a faculty member. </p>
<p>Close collaboration with members of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry is a vital and stimulating aspect of the biology program. Additional strength and breadth in biology are gained by collaborating with the Department of Marine Biology of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, with The Scripps Research Institute, and with the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. </p>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Divisional PhD Time Limit Policies</h3>
				<p>Students must be advanced to candidacy by the end of four years. Total university support cannot exceed seven years. Total registered time at UC San Diego cannot exceed seven years. </p>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Joint Doctoral Program with San Diego State University</h3>
				<p>The Division of Biological Sciences at UC San Diego participates in a joint graduate
				  program with the Department of Biology at San Diego State University, primarily
				  in the areas of cell and molecular biology, and leading to the PhD in biology. Graduate student participants in the joint doctoral program
			    are required to spend one year enrolled at UC San Diego. </p>
<p>Information regarding admission is found in the current edition of the San Diego State University Graduate Bulletin. </p>
<h2>Specialization in Anthropogeny</h2>
<p><a href="http://carta.anthropogeny.org/training/specialization-track" target="_blank">http://carta.anthropogeny.org/training/specialization-track</a></p>
<p>A transdisciplinary graduate specialization in anthropogeny is available
  for doctoral students in the Division of Biological Sciences. The aim of the
  specialization is to provide graduate students the opportunity to specialize
  their research and education in addressing the origins of the human phenomenon.
  The student’s research will be related to one of the oldest questions known
  to humankind, namely, the origins of humans and humanity. This specialization
  is not a stand-alone program, but will provide graduate students the opportunity
  to interact and communicate with peers in radically different disciplines throughout
  the duration of their PhD projects. Such communication across disciplines
  from the outset is key to fostering a capacity for interdisciplinary language
  skills and conceptual flexibility. </p>
<h3>Admission to the Specialization</h3>
<p>Students are admitted into the Division of Biological Sciences doctoral program.
  During the early stages of their program, currently enrolled biology students
  with an interest in human origins are eligible to apply for admission to the
  specialization in anthropogeny. Selected applicants will have the opportunity
  to enroll in the specialization.</p>
<h3>Specialization Requirements</h3>
<p>Students pursuing this specialization must satisfy the requirements of both
  the biology doctoral program and the specialization in anthropogeny. For the
  anthropogeny specialization, students will be required to take a series of
  courses and participate in research rounds over four years of study. It is
  advised that students begin their course work in their second year. </p>
<ol>
  <li>Course work: Introduction to Anthropogeny (BIOM 225) and Advanced Anthropogeny
    (BIOM 229) are each taken once, in the winter and spring of the students’
    second year. Current Topics in Anthropogeny (BIOM 218) is to be taken for six quarters (twice per academic year). </li>
  <li>Research Rounds: Monthly seminars during which all participating students
    talk about their respective research.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Degree Requirements (Qualifying Examination, Dissertation)</h3>
<p>Biological sciences students in the anthropogeny specialization must meet
  the departmental requirement for advancement to candidacy. In addition, students
  must meet internal deadlines, mentoring provisions, and proposal standards
  of the anthropogeny specialization track.</p>
<p>PhD students must complete a dissertation, which meets all requirements
  of the biological sciences program. In addition, it is expected that the PhD
  dissertation is broadly related to human origins and will be interdisciplinary
  in nature.</p>
<h3>Time Limits</h3>
<p>Students admitted to the specialization in anthropogeny must meet the time
  limit requirements as all other doctoral students in the Division of Biological
  Sciences. It is expected that students will retain the same time to degree
  as students not pursuing this specialization. Additional course load consists
  only of two regular courses (two quarters, twenty lectures each). The third
  proposed course takes place only three times a year, from Friday noon to Saturday
  evening.</p>
<h2>Specialization in Multiscale Biology</h2>
<p><a href="http://interfaces.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">http://interfaces.ucsd.edu/</a></p>
<p>The UC San Diego campus offers a PhD specialization in
  Multiscale Biology available to doctoral candidates in participating
