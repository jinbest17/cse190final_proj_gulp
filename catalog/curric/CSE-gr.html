To maintain good academic standing, students must be making timely and satisfactory progress toward completion of degree requirements and must maintain a minimum overall GPA of 3.0 at UC San Diego.</p>
<h5 class="program-overview-subhead-4">Course Requirements</h5>
		<p>There are breadth, depth, and elective and research requirements for each master&rsquo;s program. These course requirements are intended to ensure that students are exposed to (1) fundamental concepts and tools, (2) advanced, up-to-date views in topics outside their area (the breadth requirement), and (3) a deep, current view of their research or specialization area (the depth requirement). The interdisciplinary option requires additional course work in another department. Courses may not fulfill more than one requirement.</p>
				<h6>Breadth Requirement</h6>
				<p>The breadth requirement ensures that master&rsquo;s students share knowledge of fundamental concepts and tools from across broad areas of computer science and computer engineering. Students must complete three graduate courses (twelve units) to satisfy this requirement. Courses must be taken for a letter grade and completed with a grade of B- or higher. Breadth courses are categorized into three areas: theory, systems, and applications. Please refer to the department&rsquo;s website for a current list of courses that satisfy the breadth requirement.</p>
				<h6>Depth Requirement</h6>
				<p>The depth requirement ensures that master&rsquo;s students acquire expertise in a general research or specialization area. Students choose a depth area from the list below; students pursuing the computer engineering degree must choose that as the depth area. Students must complete three graduate courses (twelve units) from this list. Courses must be taken for a letter grade. Please refer to the department&rsquo;s website for a current list of courses that satisfy the depth requirement.</p>
				<p>The depth areas are categorized into ten areas and are listed here alphabetically:</p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>artificial      intelligence </li>
                    <li>bioinformatics</li>
                    <li>computer      engineering</li>

				<p>The 37-unit course work requirement is intended to ensure that students are exposed to (1) fundamental concepts and tools, (2) advanced, up-to-date views in topics outside their area (the <em>breadth requirement</em>), and (3) a deep, up-to-date view of their research area (the <em>elective requirement</em>). Doctoral students are expected to complete the breadth and elective requirements within the first three years of the program. All required course work must be taken for a letter grade, with the exception of CSE 292. Faculty Research Seminar, which is only offered S/U.</p>
		<p>Units obtained from a single course cannot count toward both the breadth and the elective requirements; they may only be applied toward one or the other. Doctoral students who have taken similar courses elsewhere may petition for a waiver of the required courses or for substitution by alternative courses. </p>
		<h5 class="program-overview-subhead-4">Breadth Requirement</h5>
				<p>The breadth requirement ensures that doctoral students share knowledge of fundamental concepts and tools from across broad areas of computer science and computer engineering. Each doctoral student must take each of these courses for a letter grade and maintain an overall breadth course GPA of 3.3 (except for CSE 292, for which a letter grade is not assigned). A student will typically complete all breadth courses within the first two years of graduate study. </p>
<p>Breadth courses are categorized into ten areas and are listed here alphabetically:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>artificial intelligence </li>
  <li>bioinformatics</li>
  <li>computer engineering</li>
  <li>computer systems and security</li>
  <li>database systems</li>
  <li>graphics and vision</li>
  <li>human-computer interaction </li>
  <li>programming languages, compilers,      and software engineering</li>
  <li>robotics</li>
  <li>theoretical computer science</li>
</ul>
<p>To fulfill the breadth requirement, students will select four of the ten areas and take a single course from each of these four areas.<br>
  For courses approved to fulfill the breadth requirement, please see the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17mkywGHRf8EWLQ-ePdZIIRJig9l4WWeDWdZlzbBWN3U/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">CSE graduate course structure for PhD students</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, students are required to take CSE 292, a one-unit faculty research seminar, where CSE faculty present one-hour seminars of their current research work in their areas of interest. This course is offered S/U only.</p>

<h5 class="program-overview-subhead-4">Elective Requirement</h5>
				<p>The elective requirement ensures that doctoral students acquire some depth of knowledge in a general research area early in their career, but it does not preclude them from pursuing a breadth of topics if this serves their research interests. The elective requirement is designed to be flexible and nimble enough to respond to the rapidly and constantly evolving dynamic disciplines of computer science and computer engineering. </p>
				<p>The elective requirement is also designed with heavy faculty mentorship in mind. Students will consult with their faculty advisers to develop an academic plan that will include four courses from the abovementioned four separate breadth areas and five elective courses that may be selected from an approved set of courses featured in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17mkywGHRf8EWLQ-ePdZIIRJig9l4WWeDWdZlzbBWN3U/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">CSE graduate course structure for PhD students</a>.</p>
				<p>Units obtained in the CSE 209 series, 229 series, 239 series, 249 series, 259 series, 269 series, 279 series, 289 series, 219, 290, 292, 293, 294, 298, 299, 500, and 599 do not count toward the elective requirement. </p>

                <h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Research Exam Requirement </h4>
				<p>The emphasis of doctoral studies is research and having a research adviser is essential to a student&rsquo;s ability to make adequate progress toward the degree. Students usually begin research in their first year. The research exam is intended to verify three components of the student&rsquo;s preparation for doctoral research: (1) breadth of comprehension sufficient to enable computer science research in areas beyond the topic(s) of the research exam and thesis; (2) ability to perform critical study, analysis, and writing in a focused area; and (3) research experience. </p>
<p>The research exam has both an oral part and a written part. The oral part of the research exam is distinct from, and cannot be combined with, the University Qualifying Exam. Grading criteria for each part, and standards for passing, are available from the CSE department graduate office. </p>
				<p>The research exam is conducted by a committee of three faculty members approved by the graduate committee and the chair of the department. At least two committee members must be CSE senate faculty. The student&rsquo;s adviser is not a member of the committee but is free to attend the research examination. The normative time for passing the research exam is by the end of the second year of study. A petition to the CSE graduate committee is required to take the research examination after the student&rsquo;s seventh quarter of study. The research exam must be passed by the end of the third year if the student is to continue in the doctoral program. Passing the research exam may enable doctoral students to receive the master&rsquo;s degree if they have otherwise met their master&rsquo;s degree requirements concurrently. Doctoral students who do not pass the exam after two attempts will be given the opportunity to write a thesis in order to receive a terminal master&rsquo;s degree. The master&rsquo;s degree is only granted to those students who do not already hold a master&rsquo;s degree prior to entering the CSE department at UC San Diego. </p>

<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Teaching Assistant Requirement </h4>
				<p>Teaching is an important part of a doctoral student&rsquo;s training. All students enrolled in the doctoral program must have one quarter of training as a teaching assistant. This is a formal degree requirement and must be completed before the student is permitted to graduate. The requirement is met by serving as a 50 percent teaching assistant and taking CSE 500 (Teaching Assistantship). CSE 599 (Teaching Methods in Computer Science) examines theoretical and practical communication and teaching techniques particularly appropriate to computer science, and students usually take it prior to or concurrent with the teaching assistantship.  </p>
<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Qualifying Examination and Advancement to Candidacy </h4>
				<p>The qualifying examination is a requirement for advancement to candidacy. Prior to taking the qualifying examination a student must have satisfied the departmental competency, course, and research exam requirements and must have been accepted by a CSE faculty member as a doctoral thesis candidate. All doctoral students are expected to advance to candidacy by the end of their third year, and advancement is mandatory by the end of the fourth year. The examination is administered by a doctoral committee appointed by the dean of the Graduate Division and consists of faculty from CSE and other departments. More information on the composition of the committee can be obtained from the CSE graduate office. The examination is taken after the student and his or her adviser have identified a topic for the dissertation and an initial demonstration of feasible progress has been made. The candidate is expected to describe his or her accomplishments to date as well as future work. </p>
<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Dissertation </h4>
				<p>The dissertation defense is the final doctoral examination. A candidate for the doctoral degree is expected to write a dissertation and defend it in an oral examination conducted by the doctoral committee. </p>
<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Departmental PhD Time Limit Policies </h4>
				<p>Students must be advanced to candidacy by the end of four years. Total university support cannot exceed seven years. Total registered time at UC San Diego cannot exceed eight years. </p>
		<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Obtaining an MS Degree</h4>
                <p>PhD students may obtain an MS degree along the way or a terminal MS degree by completing the PhD course work requirements (See details in Doctoral Degree Program.); AND completing four units of CSE 299/298/293 OR an additional four-unit, letter-grade approved course from the CSE graduate course structure; AND passing the PhD research exam. Please note that completion of CSE 292 is not required for PhD students to earn the MS along the way or a terminal MS.</p>
              
<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Financial Aid </h4>
				<p>Financial support is available to qualified graduate students in the form of fellowships, loans, and assistantships.
