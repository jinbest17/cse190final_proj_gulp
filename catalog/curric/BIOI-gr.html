				<p>We are witnessing the birth of a new era in biology and medicine. The confluence of unprecedented measuring capabilities and computational power has dramatically changed the questions that may be addressed in the biological and biomedical sciences and promises to empower clinical practice in fundamental ways.</p>
				<p>On the one hand, recent and novel technologies produce biological data sets of ever-increasing resolution that reveal not only genomic sequences but also RNA and protein abundances, their interactions with one another, their subcellular localization, and the identity and abundance of other biological molecules. This requires the development and application of sophisticated computational methods, encompassed by the field of <strong>bioinformatics</strong>.</p>
				<p>On the other hand, biomedical research has risen to the challenge of understanding the integrated functions of thousands of genes. Physical and functional interaction networks chart connectivities, reveal functional modules, and provide clues on the functioning of specific genes. Using mathematical models of the stochastic and dynamical events of biology reveals fundamental design principles and allows for virtual experimentation. This is a focus of the field of <strong>systems biology</strong>.</p>
				<p>In addition, rapidly increasing capabilities of rapid molecular and genomic analyses in the clinic promise to transform medical practice in unprecedented ways. The ability to cross-query data and knowledge bases provides opportunities and challenges to computational sciences interfacing with medicine to produce support systems for data management, text and language processing, privacy, clinical decision support, and data mining for knowledge discovery. These define the goals of <strong>biomedical informatics</strong>.</p>
				<p>An increasing number of young scientists have integrated the methods and approaches of the physical and life sciences in order to address biological questions in their laboratories. Their science is distinct from other genomic sciences, which typically involve applying quantitative techniques in one lab to the biological data generated in another. The power of math-based reasoning and theoretical physics is harnessed to discover fundamental aspects of biological systems. Iterations between theory and experiment, between mechanistic models and biological validation, are the key feature of Quantitative Biology.</p>
<p>Addressing these challenges requires an interdisciplinary research structure dedicated to developing intellectual and human capacity in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology (BISB), Biomedical Informatics (BMI), and Quantitative Biology (QBIO).  As such, there is an enormous need for trained professionals who are experts in biology, biomedicine, and computing. To address this need, the Bioinformatics Graduate Program at UC San Diego was founded in 2001 by Professor Shankar Subramaniam. It now includes five schools and divisions on the UC San Diego campus: the Jacobs School of Engineering (bioengineering, computer science and engineering, and nanoengineering), the Division of Biological Sciences (molecular biology, cell and developmental biology, neurobiology, ecology/behavior/evolution), the Division of Physical Sciences (chemistry and biochemistry, physics, and mathematics), the School of Medicine, and the Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. The graduate program is supported by the respective schools, divisions, and departments as well as by a substantial NIH Training Grant and more than fifty associated faculty.</p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Participating Departments</h3>
				<p>Bioinformatics and systems biology (including the graduate biomedical informatics and quantitative biology tracks) is an interdepartmental academic program for undergraduate and graduate students. It is supported broadly at UC San Diego by five schools/divisions and by the faculty from participating departments.</p>

                <h5 class="table-sample-schedule-head">Year 2 through 5</h5>
        <p>All students, regardless of their background and elective track, are expected to identify a dissertation research adviser and laboratory prior to the start of the second year. This is an academic requirement to be in good academic standing.</p>
        <p>In Year 2, students will begin preparing for their qualifying examination, to be completed before the end of the spring quarter of the second year.</p>
        <p>In Year 3, students will begin preparing for their advancement to candidacy examination, to be completed before the end of the spring quarter of the third year. </p>
        <p>The goal of the PhD program is that all students complete their dissertation and hold the public dissertation defense by the end of fifth year.<strong></strong></p>
        <h4>Research Requirement</h4>
        <p>During the academic year, all students must be enrolled in the appropriate research course for their level. Students in the BISB and BMI tracks typically do three rotations in Year 1 (BNFO 298), while students in the QBIO track typically do one quarter of PHYS 270A and two quarters of PHYS 270B. Students typically join a lab at the end of Year 1 and then enroll in research units (BNFO 299) with their dissertation adviser in Years 2 and later. BNFO 299 units may be varied to meet the full-time enrollment requirement of twelve units per quarter in fall, winter, and spring. During the summer, students are expected to do research as well, but should not enroll in BNFO 298, PHYS 270B, or BNFO 299. During all quarters and the summer, students are responsible for satisfying program requirements, including proposals, reports, presentations, committee meetings, notifying the graduate coordinator when joining/changing labs, etc.; the only difference is that students do not enroll in BNFO 298, PHYS 270B, or BNFO 299 in the summer.        </p>
        <p>In addition, each student will make periodic research presentations to the graduate program students/faculty. Students will also discuss their progress at the annual program meeting to be held each year.</p>

        <ul type="disc">

        </ul>
<h5>The Research Rotation Program</h5>
        <p>The Research Rotation Program is an integral component of the first year in our program. Each first-year student in the BISB and BMI tracks is required to undertake and pass three quarter-long (ten week) Research Rotations, one in each of the fall, winter, and spring quarters. For fall, winter, and spring rotations (but not summer rotations), students should register for BNFO 298.</p>
<p>The aims of the Research Rotation Program are</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide opportunities for students and faculty to determine whether there is a mutual rapport (&ldquo;chemistry&rdquo;) that may form the basis for a successful adviser-student relationship.<br>
          </li>
          <li>Provide students with training opportunities to learn hands-on research skills in the host laboratory.<br>
          </li>
          <li>Provide students opportunities to develop personal and scientific connections that may result in collaborative research (many students have catalyzed collaborations between laboratories) and/or appointments as coadviser/dissertation committee members.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The QBIO track has a separate lab training program. For more information, students should contact the Student Affairs office.        </p>
        <h5>Research Rotation Program Guidelines (BISB and BMI tracks)</h5>
<p>Students are responsible for identifying laboratories/faculty they are interested in joining for a Research Rotation. Students may only rotate with faculty who could also function as their dissertation advisers. All rotations must be with different faculty.</p>
        <p>Faculty are encouraged to develop short projects for rotation students so that students can get a sense of the lab and learn research skills. Rotation projects may or may not be related to possible PhD dissertation projects. Students should check the rotation projects descriptions on the program website to identify projects of interest. Please refer to our faculty directory for a full list of program faculty contact information and research interests. If faculty do not have a rotation project listed online, please contact them directly to discuss available projects.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The One-Page Rotation Project Proposal.</strong> For each rotation project, the student is required to submit a one-page proposal, signed by the rotation mentor, to the program coordinator by the first day of instruction of the quarter. Thus it is expected that faculty interested in hosting students for a rotation work with the student prior to the first day of instruction of the quarter to outline the project. The document represents a commitment by the faculty to provide the student with research rotation project and training/supervision during the quarter. </li>
        
          <li><strong>The Five-Page Rotation Project Report.</strong> To complete the ten-week rotation, the student is required to submit a five-page report, signed by the rotation mentor, to the program coordinator by the last day of instruction of the quarter. It should summarize the work, results and conclusions. The document should be structured into the following sections: aims, introduction, methods, results, discussion, and future directions. The document becomes part of the student’s academic record and provides the adviser with a record of the student&rsquo;s accomplishments. Failure to complete a rotation within a quarter will result in an Incomplete on the student’s transcript. </li>
      
          <li><strong>The Oral Rotation Project Presentation.</strong> At Research Rotation meeting(s) during the subsequent quarter, the student is required to present their Research Rotation work. The purpose of these meetings is to provide an opportunity to fine-tune presentation skills, and to encourage scientific exchange between students to develop community and inform each other of research opportunities among diverse program faculty. Currently, these presentations occur in the Student Research Talks (BNFO 283) in fall, winter, and spring quarters; for spring and summer rotations, the presentations are in the following fall quarter. </li>
          <li><strong>
          Student Evaluation.</strong> The student&rsquo;s Research Rotation work is evaluated by the rotation mentor using a confidential evaluation sheet, and by the program&rsquo;s Research Rotation program coordinators who review the five-page rotation project report and the oral presentation. The rotation mentor is required to submit the evaluation sheet by one week after the last day of instruction of the quarter to the program coordinator. 
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Second-Year Qualifying Examination</h4>
				<p>The second-year qualifying examination (BQE) is designed to examine the student&rsquo;s ability to think critically, analytically, and independently, and to apply the skills acquired in classes to a real research project. The subject of the exam is the student&rsquo;s current research project. But the focus is the student&rsquo;s critical analytical ability and command of relevant methods and subjects. The exam is normally taken before the completion of spring quarter in the student&rsquo;s second year; however, requirements for the first two years must be completed before or in the quarter it is taken, including core classes, rotations (BISB and BMI tracks), or PHYS 270A-B (QBIO track), colloquia and student seminars, and ethics.</p>
				<p>The exam consists of two components: a ten-page project proposal and an oral exam. The proposal must be submitted at least one week prior to the oral exam. The proposal will have the following sections, in line with NIH proposals: Specific Aims, Significance and Preliminary Data, Approach, and References. The references are not included in the ten-page limit. The second component is the oral exam, where the student defends their proposal.</p>
<p>For each student, the program will appoint three program faculty to form the second-year qualifying exam committee, one of whom will serve as chair. The student is responsible for scheduling the exam in the fall, winter, or spring quarter of the second year. The student&rsquo;s dissertation adviser is not included in the qualifying exam committee and does not coach the student&rsquo;s preparation for the exam. Instead, the student will present a practice talk in the Student Research Talks (BNFO 283).</p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Advancement to PhD Candidacy</h3>
				<p>After completing formal course requirements, each student will be required to take a written and oral qualifying examination. It is often known as <em>major proposition</em> or <em>Senate qualifying</em> or <em>advancement to candidacy</em> exam. Prior to this examination, each student, in consultation with his or her faculty advisers, will establish a dissertation committee of five faculty members. One adviser should have a primarily computational research focus, the other a primarily experimental research focus. The primary adviser will be the chair of the committee, and the coadviser will be the cochair. The doctoral committee for students in the bioinformatics and systems biology program should comprise a minimum of five members and at least three, including the committee chair, must be members of the BISB program. If all members are from the program, then two must have a different home department than the committee chair, and one of these two must be tenured. The dissertation advisers will have the major responsibility for the student&rsquo;s research and dissertation.</p>
<p>At UC San Diego, the university &ldquo;candidacy/Senate&rdquo; examination is a requirement for a graduate student to complete satisfactorily once a dissertation project has been decided upon. It is strongly recommended except in special circumstances that the student complete this examination prior to the end of the first three years in the program to comply with the precandidacy time limit (PCTL). Students will not be permitted to continue in doctoral status if they have not advanced to candidacy before the expiration of the precandidacy time limit. Satisfactory completion of the exam will admit the student to the candidacy of the PhD program. </p>
				<p>The format for this examination is consistent with the highest standards held by peer universities. The student must write a candidacy report generally following an NIH grant proposal format. Specifically, the report must contain Specific Aims, Research Design and Methods, and Proposed Work and Timeline; these comprise 12–15 pages. In addition (not counted in the 12–15 pages), the report must also contain a bibliography and, as attachments, any publications/supplementary material. The project and the report should be interdisciplinary in terms of computation and biology and should have input from both dissertation advisers. The report must be submitted at least one week prior to the oral exam.</p>
<p>Finally, the student must defend their thesis proposal to their committee in an oral exam (&ldquo;Advancement to Candidacy Examination&rdquo;). Students may schedule their advancement to candidacy examination between quarters (including summer) to accommodate their PhD committee members&rsquo; schedules but, in order for any academic event to be recorded, a student must be registered. This means that an advancement can only be posted to the academic record during a quarter of registration.&nbsp;It is also expected that the student will meet at least annually with the committee to update the members on his/her progress.</p>
<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Thesis or Dissertation </h4>
				<p>Each graduate student in the program will work on a dissertation project under dual mentorship, consisting of a primary adviser who is program training faculty, and a coadviser who may or may not be program training faculty, but must be from a different disciplinary area.</p>
<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Final Examination </h4>
				<p>Bioinformatics graduate students will defend their dissertation in a final oral examination. The exam will consist of (1) a presentation of the dissertation by the graduate student, (2) questioning by the general audience, and (3) closed door questioning by the dissertation committee. The student will be informed of the exam result at the completion of all three parts of the oral examination. All members of the committee must sign the final report of the doctoral committee and the final version of the dissertation will conform to the procedures outlined in the publication, <em>Instructions for the Preparation and Submission of Doctoral and Master&rsquo;s Theses</em>. </p>
<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Teaching Requirement </h4>
				<p>Each graduate student admitted to the PhD program in bioinformatics and systems biology is mandated to serve as a teaching assistant (TA) for at least two quarters. Students should enroll in BNFO 500 (Teaching Experience) or an equivalent course code in another department, during each quarter in which they are a teaching assistant. A typical teaching assistantship is 110 hours per quarter (25 percent load, two units of BNFO 500); however, this varies by class.</p>
				<p>Bioinformatics graduate students will also participate in additional TA training provided by the Graduate Division through the Teaching + Learning Commons. </p>
<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Financial Support </h4>
				<p>It is expected that all US citizens and residents admitted into the PhD program in bioinformatics and systems biology will receive financial assistance subject to their continuance and performance in the program. The assistance will be provided from (1) departmental financial commitments, (2) university financial commitments, (3) NIH-funded graduate training grant. </p>
<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">PhD Degrees with a Specialization in Bioinformatics </h4>
				<p>To harness the unique educational and research training opportunities offered by the campuswide bioinformatics effort, several UC San Diego doctoral graduate programs offer students the option to develop—within their own doctoral degree program—a curriculum and research training that has an emphasis in bioinformatics. Such students may then qualify to earn a PhD from their respective doctoral program with a Specialization in Bioinformatics.</p>
				<p>A Specialization is a formal University of California mechanism that allows a graduate student pursuing a PhD in the UC system to obtain the doctoral equivalent of a minor in a particular area of specialization. Students interested in pursuing a PhD with a Specialization in Bioinformatics will satisfy the core curriculum requirement of the bioinformatics and systems biology graduate program and pursue research that involves bioinformatics with an adviser and/or coadviser who is a training faculty of the BISB and BMI track.</p>
				<p>The following graduate programs offer a Specialization in Bioinformatics: bioengineering, biology, biomedical sciences, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, and physics.</p>
