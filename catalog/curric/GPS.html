The MIA is a two-year, full-time program.</p>
<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Core Curriculum </h4>

		<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">The Regional or Country Specialization </h4>
				<p>The regional/country specialization is made up of two courses on the student&rsquo;s chosen country <strong>or</strong> region. All students must complete at least one regional or country specialization in one of the following: China, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, or Latin America. This requirement must be completed in the following way:</p>
		<h5>Japan</h5>
				<p class="course-list-overview">GPIM 411. Business and Management in Japan</p>
				<p class="course-list-overview">GPPS 416. Postwar Politics in Japan </p>
				<h5>Korea</h5>
				<p class="course-list-overview">GPPS 484. Korean Politics</p>
				<p class="course-list-overview">GPEC 485. The Korean Economy</p>
				<h5>China</h5>
				<p class="course-list-overview">GPPS 404. Chinese Politics</p>

        <div>
                  <div> </div>
        </div>
        <h5>Latin America </h5>
                <p class="course-list-overview">GPEC 409. Economic Policy in Latin America</p>
                <p class="course-list-overview">GPPS 479. Politics and Institutions in Latin America</p>
                <h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">The Foreign Language Requirement </h4>
				<p>GPS considers foreign language competency to be an indispensable skill for international relations professionals. The foreign language requirement is designed to ensure that students achieve a level of competency to assist in their global interactions. The foreign language requirement may be satisfied in any one of three ways: (a) native speaker ability; (b) completing six quarters (four semesters) of college-level language instruction from UC San Diego or a comparable institution, with a grade of B or better in the final course; or (c) passing a special GPS-administered language exam, which is the equivalent of the final exam administered in the sixth-quarter course in the selected language. The foreign language requirement may be partially or wholly completed prior to matriculation at GPS, though unit credit for previous course work is not transferable. Please contact the GPS Student Affairs for additional information. </p>
				<p>Students must fulfill the foreign language requirement in a language that corresponds to their elected country or region of specialization. Students specializing in China, Japan, or Korea, must study Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, or Korean, respectively. Students electing to specialize in Southeast Asia may study Bahasa Indonesian, Chinese, Thai, or another approved regional language. Students in the Latin America track may take either Spanish or Brazilian Portuguese. Please contact the GPS Student Affairs for further information. </p>
				<p>UC San Diego offers a variety of language courses. Subject to demand, GPS offers four-unit, second year level language courses for international relations professionals in Japanese and Spanish.</p>
				<p>Students are placed in foreign language courses based on prior preparation and on the results of a placement test administered during fall quarter orientation. </p>
<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Career Tracks </h4>
				<p>Beyond the core curriculum, the regional specialization, and the foreign language requirement, students are offered an array of career tracks from which to choose. The career tracks provide an opportunity to focus on a specialized professional career path and to work closely with other students and faculty who share similar interests. All students must choose a career track. A career track consists of five courses (twenty units). Each track combines two required courses and three electives chosen from a list that is available from GPS Student Affairs. Below are the available career tracks, the required courses for each, and a current list of allowable electives for the track.</p>

<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Electives </h4>
				<p>Students may use remaining units to take electives across the range of GPS courses in management, political science, economics, regional studies, and language, as well as (with approval) courses offered elsewhere on campus. The number of elective units available to a student will vary depending on factors such as prior language study. Prospective students are advised to consult the GPS Office of Admissions for a full list of elective courses currently offered. No more than four non-GPS courses will be allowed to count toward the MIA degree; of these four, only three may be undergraduate courses. All must be petitioned for formal approval.</p>
				<p>Unless specifically noted, all courses must be taken for a letter grade.</p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Education Abroad Program </h3>
				<p>Students are encouraged to participate in the Education Abroad Program (EAP) in their second year of study. Though this may necessitate a third year of study to meet MIA requirements, the opportunity provides unparalleled experience in the selected regional study area and language. By petition, certain credits earned through EAP may be applied to the MIA requirements. </p>

<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Career Services</h3>
				<p>The GPS Career Services office provides students with ongoing guidance, expertise, and resources to successfully manage their careers. This personalized process begins before school starts with the Career Development Program and continues during the two-year program and throughout the students’ careers as alumni.</p>
<p>The Career Services team offers GPSCAREERS, an online system available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, which has a calendar of events, student profiles, online resumes, and a specialized database of employers with job/internship opportunities. Career consultants are available for daily scheduled appointments or quick consultations for resume writing, cover letters, effective job search strategies, interviewing skills (including videotaped mock interviews), labor market trends, job offer evaluation, and negotiation of total compensation packages. Alumni return to campus often for panels, information sessions, and employer interviews.</p>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Internships</h3>
				<p>Students are strongly encouraged to participate in a variety of internship programs aligned with their career goals in business and industry, federal and state government, and nonprofit and multilateral organizations. The Career Services office works closely with students and alumni to make connections with global employers in the nonprofit, public, and private sectors based on the students&#8217; interests.</p>
				<p>To enhance students&#8217; professional skills, GPS strongly recommends that each student participate in an internship during the summer between the first and second year. Students
				  with unpaid summer internships may receive financial support
				  from GPS donors. Internships offer opportunities to explore career options,
				  apply theoretical knowledge to real work situations, and gain experience
	    important to potential future employers. </p>

                <p>The MPP is a two-year, full-time program. There is no foreign language requirement.</p>
                <h3>The MPP Curriculum </h3>
        <p>The Master of Public Policy requires ninety-two units for graduation. All students will take eight required introductory core courses (thirty-two units) in the first year, and a capstone research seminar (four units) in the second year. Between years one and two, all students will be strongly encouraged to take an internship, either locally, domestically, or abroad. GPS has a skilled career services team to help in the location of an appropriate internship.</p>
                <p>Of the remaining fifty-six units, students will be required to complete at least one Area of Specialization of five courses (twenty units). For students choosing an international focus, twenty-four units of an appropriate GPS regional language, taken at UC San Diego at either the undergraduate or graduate level while a matriculated student in the MPP program, may be counted toward the degree when matched with relevant elective course work on the same region or country.  Petition is required by fall quarter of the second year. Language proficiency is not required.</p>

        <h4>Capstone: Year Two</h4>
                <h5 class="course-list-overview">GPCO 462. Public Policy Capstone (4) </h5>
                <p>The capstone is intended to be a summative intellectual experience directed toward the preparation of an applied research project. Depending on the policy question and its particular application, the projects may be individual or group. Students who opt to work with a group must still produce an individual capstone essay that meets the requirements of the course. Capstone projects must be approved by the faculty of record. </p>
                <p>The capstone paper is expected to demonstrate mastery of the three components of a public policy program: 1) development of the methodologies for rigorous data collection and policy analysis; 2) an in-depth understanding of the regulatory and legal politics and processes surrounding the student&rsquo;s chosen policy area; and, 3) mastery of the details of the particular issue area and policies intended or that were intended as solutions. The paper should synthesize these dimensions into a final deliverable that is empirically rigorous, grounded in the regulatory environment, and speaks directly to policy solutions. Capstone topics may be chosen based on the policy interests of a student or as a consulting response to a real-world client. The research may focus on a single case or consider policy and regulation across cases for comparison. The capstone paper will be evaluated by the faculty of record for the seminar and one program member faculty with expertise in the student&rsquo;s chosen policy area.</p>
                <p><em>Area of Specialization:</em> Students MUST complete at least one Area of Specialization chosen from the list below.

				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">The PhD Curriculum </h3>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Program of Study </h4>
				<p>The PhD in political science and international affairs prepares students for research careers in political science, with an emphasis in international policy and comparative policy analysis. The program combines the analytical skills of political science with political economy, institutional analysis, policy analysis (especially economic policy) and regional training, with special attention to East Asia and/or Latin America. </p>
        <h4>Course Requirements </h4>
        <p>The PhD curriculum in political science and international affairs is designed to provide students with basic training in the disciplinary skills of political science, as well as applications to specific policy areas and countries or regions. </p>
        <p>Eighteen courses are required prior to advancement to candidacy at the end of the second year. There is a common core sequence made up of four courses in the Department of Political Science: Political Science 203A-B and 204A-B.  No other courses may be used to substitute for these courses. The remaining course work in research skills, language, regional expertise and/or a field of specialization may be taken at GPS or in Political Science with the approval of the faculty adviser.

                <h4>General Examination</h4>
                <p>By the end of the second year, a student must stand for the general examination.&nbsp;The general examination consists of written examinations in each of two fields and an oral examination. It is expected that students complete their field requirements prior to sitting for the general examination. By the first day of spring quarter of the second year, each student must submit to the graduate coordinator a general examination plan identifying the two fields within which exams will be taken. The general examination will normally take place during the seventh week of spring quarter.&nbsp;Normally each written examination will be taken on a separate day within a one-week period, and the oral examination will be given within two weeks of the completion of the written examinations.</p>
<h4>Written Examinations</h4>
                <p>Written field examinations last six hours.&nbsp;These examinations cover major theoretical approaches in a field.&nbsp;They are structured so that passing requires general knowledge and understanding of important work in the field as a whole.&nbsp;These examinations cover in greater depth one subfield within a major research literature. Written examinations are open note and open book.&nbsp;Students are expected to do their own work and to compose their answers on the day of the examination.&nbsp;Text from computer files may not be downloaded into these answers.</p>
<h4>Oral Examinations</h4>
                <p>The oral examination normally lasts between one and two hours and covers two written examinations and the student&rsquo;s seminar paper. A student must take the oral examination, even if one of the written examinations or the seminar paper is such that it is deemed impossible to pass the entire examination.</p>
<p>Each field has a designated field coordinator, appointed by the department chair in consultation with the director of graduate studies. The field coordinator, in consultation with the faculty in the field, prepares the written examinations. Each general examination is graded by a committee of four faculty members, with two from each of the student&rsquo;s examination fields.&nbsp;These examiners are nominated by the field coordinator and appointed by the department chair.&nbsp;Students are normally informed of the composition of general examination boards during the fourth week of the spring quarter.</p>
                <p>Each general examination is graded in its entirety. A student passes or fails the entire examination, not simply parts of it.&nbsp;The examination committee may assign a grade of fail, pass, or distinction.&nbsp;A student passes the general examination if at least three examiners vote to assign a grade of pass or better.&nbsp;A student receives a grade of distinction by vote of at least three examiners. The student will receive written notification of the examination committee&rsquo;s decision. A student who fails the general examination must retake it at least one week prior to the start of the fall quarter of the third year.&nbsp;A student who fails the general examination twice will not be permitted to continue in the graduate program in political science.</p>
                <p>Good progress toward the PhD requires that a student complete the general examination by the end of the second year.&nbsp;A student who has not attempted all parts of the general examination by the end of the second year may not continue in the program.</p>
                <h4>Seminar Papers </h4>
                <p>A student must complete one seminar paper in one of his or her examination fields.&nbsp;This paper may be written as part of the requirements for a regularly scheduled seminar course or in an independent research course.</p>
                <h5>Guidelines for the Seminar Paper</h5>
        <ul>
                  <li>Acceptable article length for most journals is eight thousand to ten thousand words, and seminar papers should be a similar length.</li>
                  <li>The basic structure of the article should include the following:</li>
                  <ul><li>An introduction framing the significance of the question, sketching the answer, and (where subfield appropriate) delineating the research design and empirical findings</li>
                  <li>A comprehensive yet succinct literature review placing the research in the context of prior work on the subject</li>
                  <li>A discussion of research design (where subfield appropriate)</li>
                  <li>An appropriate empirical analysis (where subfield appropriate)</li>
                  <li>A conclusion highlighting the contributions of the research and returning to general questions</li>
                 </ul> <li><em>Papers must be</em> <em>solo authored.</em></li>
                  <li>Examples of recent published articles written by UC San Diego graduate students will be available to students upon request. </li>
        </ul>
                <p>Papers may draw from papers originally written for courses. However, it is generally the case that course papers will need substantial revision before being suitable seminar papers. Students may write papers in fields other than their first or second exam fields.  </p>
                <p>Students must identify an adviser for the seminar paper. Seminar paper advisers may be the first-year adviser but are not required to be. Seminar paper advisers may go on to supervise dissertations but are not required to do so. Advisers must agree (certified in writing, to the graduate program coordinator) to serve this purpose by <em>4:00 p.m. on Friday of the eighth week of fall quarter</em>. Penalties for failing to identify an adviser by this due date are at the discretion of the director of graduate studies. Students are advised to contact the director of graduate studies or their field chair if they are having difficulty identifying an adviser.  </p>
                <p>Students must submit a <em>rough draft</em> of the seminar paper (in hard copy and electronic form) to the graduate program coordinator by <em>4:00 p.m. on Friday of the first full week of spring quarter</em>. The graduate program coordinator is responsible for ensuring that a copy of the paper is provided to the seminar paper adviser. Students failing to submit a draft of the paper by this deadline will not be permitted to take the Comprehensive Exam in the spring quarter. Please note that this implies leaving the program. </p>
                <p>Students should submit a <em>penultimate draft</em> of the paper to the seminar paper adviser one week prior to the final draft due date. Students must submit a <em>final draft</em><strong> </strong>of the seminar paper (in hard copy and electronic form) to the graduate program coordinator by <strong>4:00 p.m. on Monday of the week prior to the written exams</strong>. Students failing to submit a final draft of the paper by this deadline will not be permitted to take the Comprehensive Exam in the spring quarter. Please note that this implies leaving the program. </p>
<h4>Departmental Workshops</h4>
                <p>During the third year, a student must be enrolled in a departmental workshop (course numbers 280–89). Departmental workshops are intended to introduce students to advanced research in political science and to facilitate the completion of the doctoral dissertation. Workshops typically meet biweekly and include discussion of common readings, public talks, and student presentations. Each field is responsible for maintaining or identifying a workshop for students writing a dissertation in that field.</p>
                <p>During the third year, each student is required to present a draft dissertation prospectus or an original piece of research to a workshop at least once. A form indicating completion of this requirement must be submitted to the graduate coordinator by the end of the third year.</p>
                <p>By October 15 of the third year, each student must identify a prospectus adviser and the tentative topic of the prospectus. Each student is responsible for submitting the appropriate form, indicating the adviser&rsquo;s name, to the graduate coordinator.</p>
<h4>Advancement to Candidacy</h4>
                <p>A student must complete one seminar paper in one of his or her examination fields.&nbsp;This paper may be written as part of the requirements for a regularly scheduled seminar course or in an independent research course.</p>
                <p>Certification that a paper fulfills the seminar paper requirement is at the sole discretion of the faculty member supervising the work (i.e., the instructor of the course for which the paper was written).</p>
                <p>A student may not take the general examination before fulfilling the seminar paper requirement. A final draft of the paper, along with the appropriate form certifying that the paper meets the seminar paper requirement, must be submitted to the graduate coordinator before the written portion of the general examination may be taken.&nbsp;Copies of the seminar paper will be distributed to the general examination committee.</p>
                <h4><strong>Dissertation </strong></h4>
                <p>By the end of the sixth year, good progress requires completion of the dissertation. A student who fails to complete the dissertation by the end of the sixth year may be denied all departmental financial assistance.</p>
                <h4>Language Competency</h4>
                <p>Students intending a field specialization in comparative politics and/or policy should assume that fluency in a relevant regional language, sufficient for the conduct of research, will be expected. Language training will be credited toward the degree.</p>
                <h4>Advising and Evaluation</h4>
                <p>Each incoming student to the PhD program in political science and international affairs will be assigned a faculty adviser in GPS. By the beginning of the third year, each student must select a faculty member from the department to serve as prospectus adviser.&nbsp;The prospectus adviser will help guide the student in writing the prospectus and selecting a dissertation committee.&nbsp;The prospectus adviser will not necessarily become the chair or a member of the dissertation committee.</p>
                <p>During the spring quarter, each student is evaluated by his or her adviser in consultation with the departmental faculty.&nbsp;The student will receive a written evaluation from the adviser each year.&nbsp;The student must sign this evaluation for it to become an official part of the student&rsquo;s departmental file. As part of the first-year review, each student must complete a plan of study that identifies a faculty seminar paper supervisor, two examination fields, a focus area, and intended preparation in each.&nbsp;This plan must be signed by the student&rsquo;s faculty adviser and submitted to the graduate coordinator by the end of spring quarter of the first year.</p>
                <h4>Doctoral Committee </h4>
                <p>The dissertation committee must have at least five members, made up of both GPS and Department of Political Science faculty and one tenured professor from outside those programs. For students whose research is intended to establish a regional or country specialization, it is expected that at least one member of the committee will have such an expertise. At least two members of the committee shall represent academic specialties that differ from the student&rsquo;s chosen specialty.</p>
                <h4>Student Petitions</h4>
                <p>To contest an evaluation or any departmental action a student must do so in writing.&nbsp;A petition should be submitted to the director of graduate studies no later than the end of the quarter following the evaluation (or other action) contested by the student.</p>

        <p class="course-list-overview">One quarter research capstone (four units)</p>
        <h5>GPCO 462. Public Policy Capstone (4) </h5>
        <p>The capstone is intended to be a summative intellectual experience directed toward the preparation of an applied research project. Depending on the policy question and its particular application, the projects may be individual or group. Students who opt to work with a group must still produce an individual capstone essay that meets the requirements of the course. Capstone projects must be approved by the faculty of record. </p>
        <p>The capstone paper is expected to demonstrate mastery of the three components of a public policy program: 1) development of the methodologies for rigorous data collection and policy analysis; 2) an in-depth understanding of the regulatory and legal politics and processes surrounding the student&rsquo;s chosen policy area; and, 3) mastery of the details of the particular issue area and policies intended or that were intended as solutions. The paper should synthesize these dimensions into a final deliverable that is empirically rigorous, grounded in the regulatory environment, and speaks directly to policy solutions. Capstone topics may be chosen based on the policy interests of a student or as a consulting response to a real-world client. The research may focus on a single case or consider policy and regulation across cases for comparison. The capstone paper will be evaluated by the faculty of record for the seminar and one program member faculty with expertise in the student&rsquo;s chosen policy area.</p>
        <p>All BA/MPP students must complete an internship between their senior and graduate years. Students will be assisted in the identification of and application to an appropriate internship by GPS Career Services. Funding for travel and/or accommodations may be available.</p>
        <p>Students who are admitted to the five-year program and either opt out in their senior year or fail to matriculate to graduate standing because of poor performance will be allowed to return to the standard BA in economics (EN25). They will be required to complete a fifth elective.</p>

				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">The Korea-Pacific Program </h3>
				<p>The Korea-Pacific Program was formed in September 1989 in recognition of the growing importance of Korea in the world, of Korean-US relationships, and of the Korean model of social and economic development. </p>
				<p>Directed by GPS Professor Stephan Haggard, the program promotes the understanding of Korea in an international context and encourages the study of Korea by offering courses on the country&#8217;s economics and politics. Research is supported on contemporary Korean political economy. Outreach to the community is offered through seminars, lectures, courses, and cultural events. </p>
				<p>In comparison with other Korean studies programs in the United States, the GPS Korea-Pacific Program is distinctive in several respects: it concentrates on contemporary Korea, focuses on policy questions, stresses the foundations of Korean economic growth, explores Korea&#8217;s international relations, and seeks to understand Korea in a broad regional context. </p>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">The ASEAN-Pacific Project </h3>
				<p>The ASEAN-Pacific Project is one of several major regional and theme-based nodes of activity within the School of Global Policy and Strategy. Its mandate is to support students and to serve as a catalyst for the development of Southeast Asia-related teaching and research activities within the school. </p>
				<p>The ASEAN-Pacific Project extends the success of the school&#8217;s original Vietnam-Pacific Project, with scope being broadened to embrace the other countries of Southeast Asia. </p>
				<p>The project is built upon private donations to the school, with this resource being supplemented by resources obtained from external grant agencies and the university. The project supports the activities of students at GPS with an interest in Southeast Asia through fellowships (for summer travel and internships) and visiting guest speakers. </p>
				<p>The project also serves as a catalyst and facilitator for research projects within the school relating to Southeast Asia. It seeks to promote disciplinary-driven work on political and economic topics pertaining to Southeast Asia, as distinct from more traditional area studies scholarship. Examples of this include recent work on national political institutions and policy-making, the dynamics of regional cooperation, food and agricultural policies, and the relocation of the global magnetic disk-drive industry to Southeast Asia. Other recent research-related initiatives include a major international workshop for PhD students in political science working on Southeast Asia, and a workshop for the US Agency for International Development on political conflict in Indonesia. </p>
