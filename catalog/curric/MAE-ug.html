				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Degree and Program Options </h3>
				<p>The Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE) offers traditional, accredited engineering programs leading to a BS degree in mechanical engineering and a BS degree in aerospace engineering. MAE also offers a traditional nonaccredited engineering program leading to a BS degree in environmental engineering. The BS programs require a minimum of 180 units. </p>
<p>All MAE programs of study have strong components in laboratory experimentation,
				  numerical computation, and engineering design. Design is emphasized
				  throughout the curricula by open-ended homework problems, by
				  laboratory and computer courses that include student-initiated
				  projects, and by senior design project courses that
				  often involve teams of students working to solve engineering
				  design problems brought in from industry. The MAE programs
				  are designed to prepare students receiving bachelor&#8217;s
				  degrees for professional careers or for graduate education
				  in their area of specialization. In addition, the programs
				  can also be taken by students who intend to use their undergraduate
				  engineering education as preparation for postgraduate professional
				  training in nontechnical fields such as business administration,
				  law, or medicine. </p>
				<p><strong class="myriad-pro-semibold">Mechanical engineering</strong> is a traditional four-year curriculum in mechanics, vibrations, thermodynamics, fluid flow, heat transfer, materials, control theory, and mechanical design. Graduates find employment in the mechanical and aerospace industries as well as electro-mechanical or biomedical industries. Mechanical engineers are involved in material processing, manufacturing, assembling, and maintenance of lifeline facilities such as power plants. </p>
				<p>Mechanical design includes conceptual design, drafting with 3-D CAD programs, stress, dynamics, heat transfer or fluid dynamics analyses, and the optimization of the total system for superior performance and customer satisfaction. In manufacturing, the objective is to enhance efficiency and economy by utilizing numerical control (NC) of machine tools, mechatronics, micromachining, and rapid prototyping. Currently, engineers have available computers, process models, and sensors to improve the quality and productivity of the manufacturing lines. In preparation for this modern era, the mechanical engineering curriculum emphasizes CAD courses, computer courses, laboratory courses, and design courses in addition to providing a strong background in basic science. </p>

<p><strong class="myriad-pro-semibold">Environmental engineering</strong> is a four-year curriculum with fundamental engineering courses in mechanics, thermodynamics, physics, chemistry, and mathematics. In the third and fourth year, an environmental engineering sequence is offered, as well as further specialization in fluid mechanics, and a wide choice of technical electives, both from within MAE and other departments. The environmental engineering major focuses on conveying an understanding and awareness of the fundamental processes associated with human industrial activity that have environmental implications, and on equipping the next generation of engineers with the tools to develop technologies that enable sustainable economic growth. </p>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Other Undergraduate Programs of Study in MAE </h3>
				<p>The <strong>engineering mechanics minor</strong> involves successful completion of seven MAE courses, including at least five upper-division courses open to students who meet the course prerequisites. Our courses provide a good introduction to engineering analysis and would be useful to nonengineering majors desiring a background that could be used in professional communication with engineers. For students who are interested in taking the fundamentals in engineering (FE) exam to become an Engineer-in-Training (EIT) in mechanical engineering, the following courses are recommended: MAE 101A-B-C, MAE 11, MAE 20, MAE 108, MAE 30A-B, MAE 170, MAE 131A, MAE 150.</p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Double Majors and Minors</h3>
				<p>It is the policy of the UC San Diego Academic Senate not to approve double majors and minors within engineering departments. </p>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Program Accreditation </h3>
				<p>The BS degree program in aerospace engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.abet.org/" target="_blank">http://www.abet.org</a>.</p>
				<p>The BS degree program in mechanical engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.abet.org/" target="_blank">http://www.abet.org</a>.</p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Major Requirements </h3>
				<p>Specific course requirements for each major program are outlined in tables in this section of the catalog. In addition to the required technical courses specifically indicated, a suggested scheduling of humanities and social science courses (HSS) are distributed in the curricula for students to use to meet college general-education requirements. To graduate, students must maintain an overall GPA of at least 2.0. Deviations from these programs of study must be approved by the Undergraduate Affairs Committee prior to taking alternative courses. In addition, technical elective (TE) course selections must have departmental approval prior to taking the courses. In the aerospace engineering BS degree program and the mechanical engineering BS degree program, TE courses are restricted to meet accreditation standards. Courses such as MAE 197 and 198 are not allowed as a technical elective in meeting the upper-division major requirements. MAE 199 may be used as a technical elective only under restrictive conditions. Policy regarding these conditions may be obtained from the department&rsquo;s Student Affairs Office. </p>
<p>Students with different academic preparation may vary the scheduling of
				  lower-division courses such as math, physics and chemistry, but should
				  consult the department. Deviations in scheduling MAE upper-division courses
				  are discouraged. Most lower-division courses
				  are offered more than once each year to permit students some flexibility
				  in their program scheduling. However, many MAE upper-division courses are
				  taught only once per year, and courses are scheduled to be consistent with
				  the curricula as shown in the tables. When possible, MAE does offer large
				  enrollment courses more than once each year. A tentative schedule of course
				  offerings is available from the department each spring for the following
			    academic year. </p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">General-Education/College Requirements </h3>
				<p>For graduation each student must satisfy general-education course requirements determined by the student&#8217;s college as well as the major requirements determined by the department. The six colleges at UC San Diego require widely different general-education courses, and the number of such courses differs from one college to another. Each student should choose his or her college carefully, considering the special nature of the college and the breadth of general education. </p>
				<p>Each MAE program allows for humanities and social science (HSS) courses so that students can fulfill their college requirements. In the aerospace engineering BS degree program and the mechanical engineering BS degree program, students must develop a program that includes a total of at least twenty-four units in the arts, humanities, and social sciences, not including subjects such as accounting, industrial management, finance, or personnel administration. It should be noted, however, that some colleges require more than the twelve HSS courses indicated in the curriculum tables. Accordingly, students in these colleges could take longer to graduate than the indicated four-year schedule. Students must consult with their college to determine which HSS courses to take. </p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Professional Licensing </h3>
				<p>All students are encouraged to take the Fundamentals
				  of Engineering (FE) examination as the first step in becoming licensed
				  as a professional engineer (PE). Students graduating from an accredited
				  program can take the PE examination after FE certification and two years
				  of work experience; students graduating from a nonaccredited program can
			    take the PE examination after FE certification and four years of work experience. </p>
<p>For further information please contact your local Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors. </p>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Mechanical Engineering </h3>
				<p>The mechanical engineering program has a traditional four-year curriculum involving mechanics, vibrations, thermodynamics, fluid flow, heat transfer, materials, control theory, and mechanical design. </p>

				<h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">Policies and Procedures for MAE Undergraduate Students </h2>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Admission to the Major </h3>
				<p>The degrees in mechanical, aerospace, and environmental engineering are capped. Because of heavy student interest in these majors, and the limited resources available to accommodate this demand, maintenance of a high-quality program makes it necessary to limit enrollments.</p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Freshman Students</h3>
				<p>Freshman students who have excelled in high school and have declared mechanical, aerospace, or environmental engineering on their UC San Diego application are eligible for direct admission into those majors. Enrollment is limited in the mechanical, aerospace, and environmental engineering majors due to heavy demand and limited resources. Students will be notified by the UC San Diego Office of Admissions whether or not they have been admitted into their chosen major based on admissions criteria and their ranking in the applicant pool.</p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Transfer Students </h3>
				<p>Applicants seeking admission as transfer students will be considered for admission into the mechanical, aerospace, and environmental engineering majors. Enrollment is limited in the mechanical, aerospace, and environmental engineering majors due to heavy demand and limited resources. Transfer students who have excelled in their community college courses, especially courses in math, physics, and chemistry, will have the strongest advantage.</p>
<p>Students who have taken equivalent courses elsewhere may request to have transfer credit apply toward the department&rsquo;s major requirements. To receive transfer credit for MAE courses, submit a petition through MAE&rsquo;s online petition portal available at <a href="http://maeweb.ucsd.edu/undergrad/petitions" target="_blank">http://maeweb.ucsd.edu/undergrad/petitions</a>. For mathematics, chemistry, and physics, transfer equivalencies are determined by the respective departments. An Undergraduate Student Petition must be submitted to each department from which you are requesting transfer credit. </p>
<p>To be eligible to transfer to the mechanical, aerospace, or environmental engineering major, you must complete the following screening courses:</p>
<ul>
		<li class="list-level-1">Calculus I—for Science and Engineering (MATH 20A)</li>
		<li class="list-level-1">Calculus II—for Science and Engineering (MATH 20B)</li>
		<li class="list-level-1">Calculus and Analytic Geometry (MATH 20C)</li>
		<li class="list-level-1">Differential Equations (MATH 20D)</li>
		<li class="list-level-1">Linear Algebra (MATH 18 or 20F)</li>
		<li class="list-level-1">Complete calculus-based physics series with lab experience (PHYS 2A, B, and C)</li>
		<li class="list-level-1">CHEM 6A </li>
	  </ul>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Continuing Students Changing Majors</h3>
				<p>Continuing students who wish to change into a capped major (mechanical, aerospace, and environmental engineering) must submit an application to the department on or before the deadline. Applications will be accepted once per year. Please see the department website at <a href="http://maeweb.ucsd.edu" target="_blank">http://maeweb.ucsd.edu</a> for details.</p>
				<p>Continuing students who wish to be considered must meet the following minimum requirements:</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>completed at least one year/three quarters in residence at UC San Diego</li>
				  <li>completed all screening courses for the requested major</li>
	    </ol>
		<p>Applications will be ranked by the student&rsquo;s grades on the date of the application. Students will be allowed into the major based on a ranking system, up to a maximum number.</p>
<p>Students who apply later than their sixth academic quarter at UC San Diego will not be considered.</p>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Academic Advising </h3>
				<p>Upon admission to the major, students should consult the catalog or MAE

				  for their program of study and contact the undergraduate advisers if they have questions. The program plan may be revised in subsequent years, but curriculum revisions require approval by the undergraduate adviser or the Undergraduate Affairs Committee. Because some course and/or curricular changes may be made every year, it is imperative that students check their UC San Diego email for notifications and consult with the department&rsquo;s undergraduate advisers regularly.</p>
				<p>Some MAE courses are offered only once a year and therefore should be taken in the recommended sequence. If courses are taken out of sequence, it may not always be possible to enroll in courses as desired or needed. If this occurs, students should seek immediate departmental advice. When a student deviates from the sequence of courses specified for each curriculum in this catalog, it may be impossible to complete an MAE major within the normal four-year period. </p>
				<p>It is recommended that MAE students meet with their department adviser at least once a quarter. In addition to the advising available through the Student Affairs Office, programmatic or technical advice may be obtained from MAE faculty members. </p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Program Alterations/Exceptions to Requirements </h3>
				<p>Variations from, or exceptions to, any program or course requirements are possible only if a petition is approved by the MAE Undergraduate Affairs Committee before the courses in question are taken. Petitions are submitted through the online petition portal, available at <a href="http://maeweb.ucsd.edu/undergrad/petitions" target="_blank">http://maeweb.ucsd.edu/undergrad/petitions</a>.</p>

<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Independent Study </h3>
				<p>MAE students may take MAE 199, Independent Study for Undergraduates, under the guidance of an MAE faculty member. This course is taken as an elective on a P/NP basis. Under very restrictive conditions, however, it may be used to satisfy one upper-division technical elective course requirement for the major. Students interested in this option must identify an MAE faculty member with whom they wish to work and propose a two-quarter research or study topic. After obtaining the faculty member&rsquo;s approval on the topic and scope of the study, the student must submit a Special Studies Course form (each quarter) and an MAE 199 as Technical Elective Contract form to the Undergraduate Affairs Committee. These forms, available on the <a href="http://maeweb.ucsd.edu" target="_blank">MAE website,</a> must be completed, approved, and processed prior to the add/drop deadline. There is a minimum GPA requirement of 3.0 when using 199s as a TE. Detailed policy in this regard and the requisite forms may be obtained from the Student Affairs Office.</p>
