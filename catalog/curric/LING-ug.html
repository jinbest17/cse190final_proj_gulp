<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p class="basic-offset-top-only">In what ways do languages differ, and in what ways are all human languages alike? These are the basic questions that the science of linguistics seeks to answer. </p>
				<p>In formulating hypotheses about language, it has been found that languages have intricate structure at a number of different levels. Phonetics studies the sounds of speech and how they are produced and perceived. Phonology studies the principles by which the sounds of a language are organized into a system and combined into syllables and larger units. Morphology studies the principles by which smaller units of meaning are combined into words. Syntax is the study of the principles by which words are combined into larger units such as phrases and sentences. Semantics studies meaning—the meanings of words and the ways the meanings of words are related to the meanings of larger units such as the phrase, the sentence, and the discourse. Linguists attempt to discover to what extent the principles at each level vary across languages, and to what extent they are universal. These principles apply to both spoken languages and signed languages. </p>
<p>Because language provides a window into the human mind, linguistics plays a central role in the study of human cognition and figures prominently in the fields of cognitive science and psychology. We know, for example, that children succeed in learning language relatively quickly at a time when their other cognitive abilities are still developing. The universal properties of human language that linguists discover can be used to provide models of this acquisition process, to explain why it occurs so rapidly, and to make specific predictions about the way it unfolds. Second language acquisition and acquisition of signed languages provide important windows into the acquisition process. The results of linguistic research can also be tested directly in computational models and experimental studies of how language is represented and processed in the mind (psycholinguistics) and brain (neurolinguistics). Language can also be studied in terms of its function as a cognitive system shared by an entire society (sociolinguistics); sociolinguists investigate the ways in which the language use is affected by the social environment. </p>
<p>The Department of Linguistics offers a series of lower-division courses designed to introduce students to the scientific study of language in the broader perspective of a liberal arts education. These are LIGN 3 (Language as a Social and Cultural Phenomenon), LIGN 4 (Language as a Cognitive System), LIGN 5 (The Linguistics of Invented Languages),  LIGN 7 (Sign Language and Its Culture), LIGN 8 (Languages and Cultures in America), and LIGN 17 (Making and Breaking Codes). These courses may be used to satisfy the Marshall College disciplinary breadth requirement. Lower-division linguistics courses may be used to satisfy the social sciences requirement at Muir College and Revelle College, and they partially fulfill the requirements for a program of concentration in Warren College. In addition, certain linguistics courses satisfy the American Cultures requirement in Revelle College and the cultural diversity requirement in Muir College and Warren College. LIGN 17 (Making and Breaking Codes) satisfies the Thurgood Marshall Computational Skills requirement in addition to the formal skills requirement in Warren College and in the Human Development Program. This course also satisfies the Structured Reasoning requirement in Sixth College. Students should consult their college advising offices to determine which linguistics courses satisfy these other requirements. </p>
				<p>Linguistics courses are required for the International Studies—Linguistics major, and are relevant to a wide range of other fields of study at UC San Diego, including anthropology, cognitive science, communication, computer science, human development, law and society, psychology, and sociology, as well as areas such as African studies, Chinese studies, critical gender studies, ethnic studies, Jewish studies, Latin American studies, and others. In some cases certain linguistics courses count toward a major or minor in one of these departments or programs. Students should consult with a faculty adviser in linguistics and the other department or program when deciding on their course of study. </p>
<p>Students are strongly encouraged to participate in the UC Education Abroad Program (EAP), the Opportunities Abroad Program (OAP), or the Global Seminars (GS) program. Students considering these options should discuss their plans with the department undergraduate adviser before going abroad.  Detailed information on EAP/OAP/GS is found in this catalog and at the <a href="http://studyabroad.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Study Abroad UC San Diego website</a>. </p>
<p>The Department of Linguistics oversees the Linguistics Language Program, which offers basic language instruction in Arabic, ASL, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish. Courses from the Language Program satisfy general-education requirements, as well as the Department of Linguistics language requirement. Graduate students who require a reading knowledge of French or German may enroll in LIFR 11 or LIGM 11, respectively. </p>
				<p>The department also offers language instruction for individuals who grew up in an English-speaking environment while speaking a different language at home (currently Filipino, Hindi, Korean, Persian, and Vietnamese; other languages including Arabic, Armenian, and Cantonese may be added if student demand is sufficient). Instruction in these languages is designed to raise students&rsquo; linguistic and cultural competence to professional levels. Finally, directed self-instruction is available for a wide variety of languages through LIDS 19. </p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Please check with the department’s student affairs officers for updates concerning programs and course offerings. </p>
				<p class="anchor-parent"><a class="anchor" id="major"></a></p><h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">The Major Program </h2>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">General Requirements </h3>
				<p>Every linguistics major (except the language studies major) must satisfy
				  the undergraduate language requirement and must successfully complete a
				  minimum of twelve upper-division courses. In addition to the general major,
			    the department offers a set of enriched major programs in various specializations. </p>
        <p>Except for LIGN 199, no course taken on a Pass/Not Pass basis
                  may be counted toward a linguistics major. No more than one
                  quarter of LIGN 199 may be counted toward a linguistics major.
          For the general linguistics, language and society, cognition and language, and speech and language sciences majors, at least six out of the twelve upper-division linguistics courses counted toward the major must be linguistics courses taken in residence at UC San Diego. For
                  the language
                  studies major, at least six out of the twelve upper division
                  courses counted toward the major must be
                  taken at UC San Diego, and at least four of these must be linguistics
          courses that satisfy Part A of the language studies course requirements.
          A letter grade of C– or better is required for every course counted
                  toward a linguistics major, including courses taken to satisfy
                  the department’s undergraduate language requirement.
        </p>
                <h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Required Linguistics Courses </h3>
				<p>Linguistics 101 is required as an introduction to the field and serves as the prerequisite to certain other courses. Students who choose a linguistics major should enroll in it as early as possible. </p>

                <h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Language Studies Major </h3>
				<p><strong class="myriad-pro-semibold">Students majoring in language studies must consult with the language studies faculty adviser to approve an individual curricular plan. </strong></p>
				<p>The language studies major is designed for students who wish to pursue the study of a particular language from a variety of perspectives. To this end, students will take courses in linguistics and literature, as well as electives in linguistics, literature, culture, and area studies. This major provides preparation for a variety of careers that make use of second language skills. Depending on the elective emphasis, these include international business/law, teaching, translation, interpreting, linguistics, and foreign service. Each language studies major will specialize in one <strong class="myriad-pro-semibold">language of concentration</strong>. In principle, this could be any language other than English. However, some languages may require that some course work be completed outside UC San Diego. <strong class="myriad-pro-semibold">Hence, it is recommended that language studies majors consider a year abroad. </strong>Students whose language of concentration is <strong class="myriad-pro-semibold">American Sign Language</strong> will need to consult the faculty adviser for individualized requirements; these students may also consider an exchange year at Gallaudet University. </p>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Requirements</h3>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Lower-division preparation: </h4>
				<ul>
					<li class="list-level-1">Two years of language instruction in the language of concentration, or equivalent proficiency </li>

				</ul>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Upper-division requirements: </h4>
				<p><strong>Note: </strong>at least two of the upper-division courses must be conducted in the language of concentration. Students are encouraged to increase their academic exposure to their language of concentration by taking one-unit seminars in the language and by participating in the EAP program. </p>
				<ol class="upper-alpha">
				  <li>Six upper-division linguistics courses, as follows:<br />
<p class="course-list-courses">LIGN 101. Introduction

                <h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Honors Program </h3>
				<p>The department offers an honors program for outstanding students. Those students who have a 3.75 GPA in linguistics (3.25 overall) at the end of their junior year are eligible to participate. Students interested in participating in the honors program should consult with their department adviser: admission to the program requires nomination by the adviser and approval of the department faculty. </p>
				<p>The honors program requires that two graduate linguistics courses be taken as part of the twelve required courses for the major, and further requires one quarter of LIGN 199H. During one of the two graduate courses, the student, in consultation with the instructor and a proposed faculty adviser (if different from the instructor), will begin a substantial research project which will be continued during the quarter of 199H and will culminate in an honors paper. Responsibility for proposing possible projects and completing necessary paperwork rests with the student. Upon successful completion of the requirements the designation &ldquo;with distinction,&rdquo; &ldquo;with high distinction,&rdquo; or &ldquo;with highest distinction&rdquo; will appear on the student&rsquo;s diploma. </p>
				<p>Students interested in participating in the honors program should approach and consult with a departmental faculty member who would serve as their adviser; admission to the program requires nomination by the adviser and approval of the department faculty. </p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Independent Study and Directed Group Study in Linguistics for Majors </h3>
				<p>Upon presentation of a written study proposal or project, and with the consent of a faculty member who would serve as the adviser for the project, linguistics majors with at least a 3.5 GPA in the major courses may request permission to undertake independent study in linguistics (LIGN 199). No more than one such course (to be taken Pass/Not Pass) may count toward the major. </p>
        <h4>The Global Concentration Program</h4>
				<p>The Global Concentration in Linguistics is a cluster of courses with an international or global focus. The Global Concentration can be applied to any of the four linguistics majors. Students must satisfy the three requirements listed below to receive &ldquo;Global Concentration&rdquo; recognition on their academic transcripts.</p>
				<h5>Requirement 1: A minimum of eight units earned through study abroad, of which a minimum of four units would count toward the major</h5>
				<p>These units may be earned through the Education Abroad Program, Opportunities Abroad Program or Global Seminars, and must have academic transcripts. Students petition to have courses counted toward their Global Concentration when they return from study abroad, just as they would petition to have courses count toward their major or minor. UC San Diego Global Seminars constitute eight units, and fulfill this criterion without the need for petition.    </p>
				<h5>Requirement 2: Demonstration of proficiency in a second language through the fourth quarter of university-level instruction, or its equivalent </h5>
				<p>Global Concentrations at UC San Diego require second language proficiency. All linguistics majors must independently satisfy this requirement as part of the general requirements for a major in linguistics. </p>
				<h5>Requirement 3: A minimum of two courses with department-identified global content</h5>
				<p>The following linguistics courses are approved global content courses. This list includes two study abroad Global Seminar (GS) courses. See <a href="GS.html">UC San Diego Global Seminars Program</a> for more information. </p>
				<h6>Global Content Linguistics courses</h6>

				<p class="course-list-overview">LIGN 187GS. The Art, Language, and Culture of Flamenco</p>
				<p>Courses taken while on study abroad may be allowed to satisfy the department global content requirement. Students must petition study abroad courses to satisfy this requirement. </p>
				<h4>General Linguistics, Cognition and Language, Language and Society Majors</h4>
				<p>Some courses from other department are preapproved to count toward General Linguistics, Cognition and Language, and Language and Society majors. The following select courses from that list qualify as global content courses. (Students may petition additional courses in other departments to count if they are judged to have sufficient global content.)</p>
				<h6>Global Content language-related courses in other departments</h6>

<p class="anchor-parent"><a class="anchor" id="minor"></a></p><h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">The Minor Program </h2>
				<p>The <em>Linguistics</em> minor consists of LIGN 101, plus six additional courses in linguistics, at least four of which must be upper division. </p>
				<p>For all courses counted toward the linguistics minor, the student must receive letter grades of C– or better. Courses counted toward the minor may not be taken on a Pass/Not Pass basis, except LIGN 199. Only one quarter of LIGN 199 may be counted toward the minor. </p>
				<p>The <em>Language Studies </em>minor consists of seven courses, at least five of which must be upper division: </p>
				<p><em>Literature: </em>One upper-division literature course is required in the language of concentration. This will require proficiency as well as lower-division prerequisites. Therefore, the lower-division courses of the minor may consist of prerequisites for the upper-division literature requirement. American Sign Language students may substitute a nonliterature upper-division elective with approval of the faculty adviser. </p>
				<p><em>Linguistics: </em>LIGN 101 is required. In addition students must take a “Structure of” language of concentration course (e.g., LIGN 143 Structure of Spanish). If no such course is available, the student must consult with the undergraduate adviser regarding a possible substitution. </p>
				<p><em>Other: </em>Two additional courses that deal with general linguistics, the language of concentration (e.g., literature), or the corresponding culture, subject to approval of the faculty adviser are required. </p>
		<p>The<em> Speech and Language Sciences </em>minor consists of seven courses and one lower-division statistics course.</p>
				<p>For all courses counted toward the speech and language sciences minor, the student must receive letter grades of C– or better. Courses counted toward the minor may not be taken on a Pass/Not Pass basis, except LIGN 199. Only one quarter of LIGN 199 may be counted toward the minor.</p>
