<p>Admission to the MEng, MS, the MS Medical specialization, and PhD, as well as to the PhD with specializations in bioinformatics, computational neuroscience, multiscale biology, and quantitative biology are in accordance with the general requirements of the Graduate Division. Applicants are required to have completed a BS and/or MS degree by time of admission in a branch of engineering, natural sciences, mathematics, or quantitative life sciences. MS and PhD applicants must have a GPA of 3.4 or better in technical courses. MEng applicants should have competitive grades (greater than a 3.2 GPA). All applicants must submit GRE General Test scores, as well as three letters of recommendation from individuals who can attest to their academic or professional competence and to the depth of their interest in pursuing graduate study. Attention will be paid to the background and statement of purpose to ensure that they are consistent with the goals of the program. For example, whereas undergraduate research experience and the intention to pursue a research career or advanced studies are qualifications and interests typically well suited to the MS program, industrial experience and the intention to pursue a professional career are better suited to the MEng program. </p>
<p>A minimum speaking score of 85 (internet based) on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or a band 7 on the IELTS is required of all international applicants whose native language is not English and whose undergraduate education was conducted in a language other than English. There is a minimum requirement score of 23 on the speaking portion for the TOEFL. Students who score below 100 on the TOEFL examination are strongly encouraged to enroll in an English as a Second Language program before beginning graduate work. (UC San Diego Extension offers an English language program during the summer as well as the academic year.) Admission to the MS or PhD degree program is designated when the applicants are judged to be appropriately qualified to pursue the degree requested at the time of application. Applicants are considered for admission for the fall quarter only. </p>
<p>Nonmatriculated students are welcome to seek enrollment in bioengineering courses via UC San Diego Extension&rsquo;s Concurrent Enrollment program. However, such enrollment in a bioengineering graduate course must be approved by the instructor. </p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Contiguous Bachelor’s/Master’s Program </h3>
        <p>A contiguous program leading to a bachelor of science and a master
          of science degree in bioengineering is offered to undergraduate students
          who are enrolled in any of the major programs offered by the Department
          of Bioengineering. Students interested in obtaining the MS within one year following completion of the BS may apply to
          the department for admission to the program during spring quarter
          prior to the receipt of the BS. The program is open only to
          UC San Diego undergraduates. </p>
        <p>To be eligible, students must have completed the first two quarters
          of their junior year in residence at UC San Diego and have an upper-division
          GPA of 3.5 or better and a 3.0 overall UC GPA. Twelve units of bioengineering
          graduate-level courses must be completed during the student’s senior
          undergraduate year, <em>in addition</em> to the requirements for the
          bachelor’s degree; these twelve units will count toward the requirements
          for the master’s degree only and must be taken for a letter grade.
          It is the responsibility of the prospective BS/MS student to select
          a bioengineering faculty member who is willing to serve as the student’s
          adviser. The student will also arrange (with their faculty adviser’s
          approval) a schedule of courses for the senior year that will fulfill
          the requirements for the BS while also serving the program
          planned for the MS. Students are expected to meet the requirements
          for the MS in one year (three consecutive academic quarters)
          from the date of the receipt of the BS. </p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Master of Science Degree Programs </h3>
				<p>The master of science (MS) program is intended to extend and focus the broad undergraduate background in bioengineering to prepare students for specific career options. It is built around a flexible core that provides advanced training in applied physical and biological sciences that is customized for providing advanced knowledge and expertise for training in specialized bioengineering fields. These include, but are not restricted to, the biomedical industry and related entrepreneurial activities, direct biomedical and health-care engagement including preparation for the medical career, and in-depth training for those wishing to gain experience in academic research and considering graduate studies at the doctoral level. The MS may be terminal or may be obtained while pursuing a doctorate. Doctoral degree students wishing to obtain the MS should refer to<em> &ldquo;</em><a href="../curric/BENG-gr.html#obtain">Obtaining an MS Degree</a><em>&rdquo;</em> under the section, <em>&ldquo;</em><a href="../curric/BENG-gr.html#doctoral">Doctoral Degree Program</a><em>.&rdquo; </em></p>

</ul>

        <h5>Comprehensive Examination</h5>
        <p>The comprehensive examination will be prepared and administered by a faculty committee selected by the Graduate Program Committee. The student will be provided with an exam that is oral, written, or a combination of both, designated by the Exam Committee, with the objective to strengthen the student&rsquo;s knowledge in selected areas that can best prepare the student for his or her professional career. The examination will cover a broad range of topics chosen from upper-division undergraduate courses, and graduate courses taken during the MS-MED program (including BENG 294A, 294B, and/or 294C). After the examination, the Exam Committee will issue a passing or failing grade. If a student fails in the first attempt, he or she may retake the examination at the next scheduled comprehensive examination period. No more than two attempts to pass the exam are allowed. The MS-MED comprehensive examination may be held at the end of any quarters throughout the year.</p>
<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Master&#8217;s Time Limit Policy </h4>
				<p>Full-time MS students are permitted seven quarters in which to complete all requirements. While there are no written time limits for part-time students, the department has the right to set individual deadlines if necessary. </p>
				<p>A strong effort is made to schedule MS-level course offerings so that
				  students may obtain their MS in one year of full-time
				  study or two years of part-time study (see regulations on part-time
				  study under “<a href="../front/GradAdmission.html">Graduate Division</a>”).
				  Entering students who do not meet the prerequisites of these core courses may have to take some basic courses to make up the deficiency.
</p>
                <p>A candidate admitted for the MS who wishes to transfer
                  to the PhD program must consult the Student Affairs Office
                  concerning the transfer before completion of the MS
                  program. </p>
<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Change of Degree Aim </h4>
				<p>Upon completion of the requirements for the MS, students are not automatically eligible for admission to the PhD program. </p>
				<p>MS candidates who wish to pursue a doctorate must submit an application for a change in status to the Graduate Studies Committee. The application is made available each spring by the Student Affairs Office. The application must be approved and signed by a bioengineering faculty member who expects to serve as the student&#8217;s PhD adviser. Applications will be reviewed by an ad hoc faculty committee. If the committee recommends that the student has good potential for success in the doctoral program, the student will be given the opportunity to take an oral examination equivalent to the PhD departmental qualifying examination. At the time of that exam, an assessment will be made concerning admission to the PhD program.</p>
				<p>A change of status from a master&#8217;s program to the doctoral program requires that the student meet the minimal grade point average required by the department of doctoral candidates. </p>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Master of Engineering Degree Program </h3>
				<p>The department offers a <strong>master of engineering (MEng) degree</strong>.
				  The purpose of this degree is to prepare design and project engineers for
				  careers in the medical and biological engineering industries within the
				  framework of the graduate program of the Department of Bioengineering.
				  It is a terminal professional degree in engineering, which includes recognition
				  of the importance of breadth in technical knowledge and sufficient electives
				  to address job-specific interests and professional skills such as economics,
				  management, and business. It is intended for students who are primarily
				  interested in engineering design, development, manufacturing, and management
			    within an industrial setting. </p>
                <p>Students who may be interested in continuing to the PhD
                  program should apply to the MS program and not the terminal
                  MEng program.</p>
                <p>The MEng program is a flexible, course-intensive terminal
                  professional degree, designed to be completed in one academic
                  year of full-time study. It does not require a comprehensive
                  exam. However, students must enroll for technical elective
                  credit in BENG 295, Bioengineering Design Project and Industrial
                  Training, under the direction of a faculty instructor.
                  This is done by participating in the Graduate Industrial Training
                  Program, which allows students to work in an industrial setting
                  on bioengineering projects in order to gain practical experience.
                  (See “<a href="BENG-ug.html#industrial">Industrial Internship
                  Program</a>” and “<a href="BENG-ug.html#industrial">Graduate
                  Industrial Training Program</a><strong>” </strong>sections
                  of this catalog.) BENG 295 course requirements include a written
  technical report. </p>
                <p>In addition to enrolling in one to two quarters (four to eight
                  units) of BENG 295, Bioengineering Design Project and Industrial
                  Training, students must select six courses from the approved
                  core areas, one to two courses from the approved technical
                  elective course list, and three courses from the approved general
                  elective course list. Such core courses and technical and general
                  electives are described below. In selecting breadth courses,
                  students must be mindful of the prerequisite requirements for
                  some of the courses listed. The lists below are based on the
                  current graduate course offerings of the bioengineering and
                  other engineering departments. The Graduate Studies Committee
                  will review the MEng course lists annually and update them
                  as course offerings change. MEng students are required to
                  complete course requirements with a grade of B or better. </p>
                <p>Students must also enroll in BENG 291, Senior Seminar I: Professional
                  Issues in Bioengineering. This course instills skills for personal
                  and organizational development during lifelong learning. Students
                  prepare portfolios and a model NIH small business research
                  grant.</p>

				<p>The <strong class="myriad-pro-semibold">bioengineering PhD program</strong> is intended to prepare students for a variety of careers in research and teaching. Therefore, depending on the student&#8217;s background and ability, research is initiated as soon as possible. Bioengineering students have specific course requirements and must maintain a minimum grade point average of 3.4 in these courses. Students, in consultation with their advisers, develop course programs that will prepare them for the departmental qualifying examination and for their dissertation research. These programs of study and research must be planned to meet the time limits established to advance to candidacy and to complete the requirements for the degree. Doctoral students who have passed the departmental qualifying examination may take any course for an S/U grade with the exception of courses required by the Departmental or Senate Qualifying Examination Committee. It is recommended that all bioengineering graduate students take a minimum of two courses (other than research) per academic year after passing the departmental qualifying examination. Details can be obtained from the Student Affairs Office. </p>

<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Doctoral Examinations </h4>
				<p>A bioengineering PhD student is required to pass three examinations. The first is a departmental qualifying examination, which must be taken after spring quarter of the first year of study. The exam is designed to ensure that all successful candidates possess a firm command of the engineering and life science subjects that form the foundations of bioengineering research and their integration at a level appropriate for the doctorate. It is administered by a committee designated by the department, consisting of departmental faculty members and, in some cases, other faculty members from a related academic department (e.g., MAE, ECE, SOM). The scope of the oral examination includes the two broad areas that form the core first-year PhD curriculum, namely engineering physics and life science. The purpose of the exam is not merely to recapitulate the content of first-year courses, but rather to establish that students are able to synthesize this knowledge and apply it to solve problems in contemporary bioengineering research.</p>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Curriculum for PhD Students </h4>
				<p>Each incoming student will be assigned a bioengineering faculty adviser who will serve as a graduate adviser until the student chooses a thesis adviser. This assignment is noted in the departmental offer letter.</p>
				<h5>First-Year Requirements</h5>
				<p>All bioengineering students in their first year of study are expected to enroll in the six required core courses in the Engineering Physics and Life Science tracks listed below. First-year students are also required to take both one-credit seminars: BENG 281 (all three quarters) and BENG 282 (F); one quarter of BENG 501. Teaching Experience (W or S) and an ethics course are also required.</p>

          Remaining requirements for fulfilling full-time enrollment are distributed between electives and research rotations. Students have the option of rotating in labs during their first year. Students may enroll in up to two rotations (BENG 298L, four units) during their first year. A one- to two-page laboratory report is due at the end of each rotation. Credit for this work requires approval from the faculty in charge of the laboratory where the work is performed. BENG 298L credit counts toward the number of units necessary for full-time student status, but not toward fulfilling academic course work requirements.</li>
          <li>BENG 299. Research<br>
          Students must be enrolled in twelve units to maintain full-time status. Students enroll in BENG 299 and/or electives to fulfill this requirement. Credit for BENG 299 research units is adjudicated upon approval of the faculty that sponsors and supervises the research carried out by the enrolled student.		  </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <strong class="myriad-pro-semibold">Senate qualifying examination</strong> is the second examination required of bioengineering PhD students. In preparation for this examination, students must have completed the departmental qualifying examination, the departmental teaching experience requirement, all required course work (six core and four approved elective courses), obtained a faculty research adviser, identified a topic for their dissertation research, and made initial progress. At the time of application for advancement to candidacy, a doctoral committee responsible for the remainder of the student’s graduate program is appointed by the Graduate Council. The committee conducts the Senate qualifying examination, during which students must demonstrate the ability to engage in thesis research. This involves the presentation and defense of a plan for the thesis research project.  Upon successful
				  completion of this examination, students are advanced to candidacy and
				  are awarded the Candidate in Philosophy degree (see “<a href="../front/GradAdmission.html" target="_blank">Graduate
				  Division</a>”
			    section in this catalog). </p>
				<p>The <strong class="myriad-pro-semibold">Dissertation Defense </strong>is the final PhD examination. Upon completion of the dissertation research project, the student writes a dissertation that must be successfully defended in a public presentation and oral examination conducted by the doctoral committee. A complete copy of the student&#8217;s dissertation must be submitted to each member of the doctoral committee approximately four weeks before the defense. It is understood that this copy of the dissertation given to committee members will not be the final copy, and that the committee members may suggest changes in the text at the time of the defense. This examination must be conducted after completion of at least three quarters from the date of advancement to doctoral candidacy. Acceptance of the dissertation by the Graduate Division and the university librarian represents the final step in completion of all requirements for the PhD. </p>
				<p>There is no formal foreign language requirement for doctoral candidates. Students are expected to master whatever language is needed for the pursuit of their own research.</p>
				<p class="anchor-parent"><a class="anchor" id="obtain" ></a></p><h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Obtaining an MS </h4>
				<p>PhD students may obtain the MS by completing the course work requirements and by passing the PhD departmental qualifying examination. Course work requirements include successful completion of a total of forty-eight units of credit comprising engineering physics, life science and five approved elective courses <em>(</em>see details on course work requirements in the section &ldquo;<a href="../curric/BENG-gr.html#doctoral">Doctoral Degree Program</a>&rdquo;<em>)</em>. Students should consult with the Student Affairs Office in advance of their second year of study concerning required paperwork and deadlines for conferral of the MS. </p>
<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">PhD Time Limit Policy </h4>
				<p>Precandidacy status is limited to three years. Doctoral students are eligible for university support for six years. The defense and submission of the doctoral dissertation must be within seven years. </p>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Evaluations </h4>
				<p>In the spring of each year, the faculty evaluates each doctoral student&#8217;s overall performance in course work, research, and prospects for financial support for future years. A written assessment is given to the student after the evaluation. If a student&#8217;s work is found to be inadequate, the faculty may determine that the student cannot continue in the graduate program. </p>
				<h4>PhD in Bioengineering with Specialization in Bioinformatics </h4>
                <p>A specialization in bioinformatics spanning four divisions—Biological Sciences, Physical Sciences, Jacobs School of Engineering, and Health Sciences. Intended for students who have an interdisciplinary persuasion to work across computers, biology, medicine, and engineering. Candidates will be admitted into participating graduate programs (bioengineering, biology, biomedical sciences, chemistry and biochemistry, computer science and engineering, mathematics, and physics) and work toward degrees in their home departments with a specialization in bioinformatics. The specialization will serve to educate future generations of bioinformatics researchers. Understanding how genomes work requires sophisticated computer-based information handling tools (bioinformatics), and new high throughput technologies for understanding the function of genes on a genome-wide scale (functional genomics).  </p>
                <h4>PhD in Bioengineering with Specialization in Computational Neuroscience</h4>
