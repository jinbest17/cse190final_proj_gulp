				<p>UC San Diego offers the master of arts and doctor of philosophy in music as well as a doctor of musical arts. Areas of emphasis for the MA include Composition, Computer Music, Integrative Studies, and Performance. For the PhD, areas of emphasis offered are Composition, Computer Music, and Integrative Studies. The doctor of musical arts has an emphasis in Contemporary Music Performance. </p>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Composition </h3>
				<p><a href="http://musicweb.ucsd.edu/grad/grad-pages.php?i=201" target="_blank">http://musicweb.ucsd.edu/grad/grad-pages.php?i=201</a></p>
				<p>The Composition Program is committed to nourishing the individual gifts and capacities of student composers in a diverse and active environment, with an emphasis on intensive personal interaction between faculty and student. The faculty mentor considers a student&#8217;s particular goals and then attempts to strengthen his or her technical capacity to meet them. The diversity and liveliness of our program itself often challenges students to reevaluate their goals. </p>
				<p>An incoming member in the MA or PhD program begins with a yearlong
				  seminar (taught by a different faculty composer each quarter)
				  and continues with individual studies thereafter. At the close
				  of the first year fall quarter and again after the following
				  spring quarter, the entire composition community gathers for
				  a daylong “jury.” Each seminar member is allotted a block
				  of time during which the composition that has just been completed
				  is performed and recorded in a carefully rehearsed presentation.
				  There is a detailed discussion of each work by the faculty
				  composers, and the student has opportunity to comment, explain,
				  and pose questions. Following the performance and discussions
				  of this day, the composition faculty meets to assess the students&#8217; work
				  collectively and to offer any guidance deemed necessary. This
				  process is at the root of the uniqueness of the UC San Diego
				  program, and manifests the range, seriousness, and vitality
				  with which compositional issues are explored here. </p>
				<p>After completing three quarters of seminar and two juries, students come to know something about the ideas and perspectives of each faculty composer; the faculty, in turn, is aware of each student&#8217;s objectives and needs. At this point, an individual mentor is agreed upon and this relationship becomes the center of the student&#8217;s continuing work as the degree is completed. A Third Year Forum presents, under departmental auspices, a work composed by each third-year PhD composer in the four quarters since his or her second jury. As a part of preparation for this forum, each student composer is expected to have a faculty performer on his or her PhD committee (as a regular member, or as an additional sixth member). The faculty performer is the student&#8217;s performance mentor and guide in interfacing with the performance community. There is also a biweekly Focus on Composition Seminar at which faculty, students, and selected visitors present work of interest (compositional, analytical, technological, and even whimsical). </p>
				<p>The seminars serve to foster mutual awareness within the student composer group. Collegial relationships develop and lead not only to friendships, but also to further creative outlets in cooperative projects, including the student-run Composers&#8217; Forums, performance collectives, and recital projects. UC San Diego performers—faculty and student—are all committed to the playing of new music, and frequent composer/performer collaborations are a vital aspect of life in the Department of Music. </p>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Computer Music </h3>
				<p><a href="http://musicweb.ucsd.edu/grad/grad-pages.php?i=202" target="_blank">http://musicweb.ucsd.edu/grad/grad-pages.php?i=202</a></p>
				<p>The Computer Music Program emphasizes research in new techniques for electronic
				  music composition and performance, catalyzed through an active concert
				  program of new works by students, faculty, and visitors. Areas of research may
				  include </p>
				<ul>
					<li class="list-level-1">new audio synthesis techniques </li>
					<li class="list-level-1">audio signal processing </li>
					<li class="list-level-1">music cognition </li>
					<li class="list-level-1">live improvisation with and by computers </li>
					<li class="list-level-1">integrating audio and video </li>
					<li class="list-level-1">electronic spatialization of sounds </li>
					<li class="list-level-1">techniques for live electronic music performance </li>
					<li class="list-level-1">computer music software and HCL design </li>
					<li class="list-level-1">audio analysis and feature detection </li>
				</ul>
				<p>The Computer Music Program encourages work that overlaps with the other programs of study: Composition, Performance, and Integrative Studies. Analyzing and performing electronic music repertoire as well as writing new music involving electronics are encouraged. </p>
				<p>The first-year computer music curriculum is centered on a yearlong “backbone” course covering the essentials of the computer music field. This material divides naturally into three portions (audio signal processing, compositional algorithms, and musical cognition). </p>
				<p>In their second year, students work individually with faculty members to deepen their mastery of their subject areas of concentration. For example, a student wishing to focus on signal processing aspects might study techniques for digital audio analysis and resynthesis, drawing on the current research literature. </p>
				<p>After having taken a critical mass of such subjects, PhD students enter a qualifying examination preparation period, and, once successful, they start their dissertation research. </p>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Integrative Studies (IS)</h3>
				<p><em>(formerly Critical Studies/Experimental Practices)</em></p>
				<p><a href="http://musicweb.ucsd.edu/grad/grad-pages.php?i=203" target="_blank">http://musicweb.ucsd.edu/grad/grad-pages.php?i=203</a></p>
				<p>Drawing on a wide range of academic fields, including critical and cultural theory, ethnomusicology, music cognition, new media studies, sound studies, and ecocriticism, among others, the IS program combines an exploration of contemporary music making with an examination of ideas and concepts that are relevant to its nature, creation, production, and reception. Exposure to a range of disciplines and interdisciplinary methods prepares students to pursue innovative scholarship and creative work.</p>
				<p>IS graduate students initially enroll in introductory courses taught by core faculty members designed to present intersecting ways of researching sound, music, and culture, and which are designed to generate possibilities for future independent and collaborative research. In subsequent quarters students choose between a variety of focused and revolving topic seminars. Recent seminars have included Sounding Sex, Race, and Gender; Post-Colonial Hermeneutics; Music, Sound, and Biopolitics; Reading Ethnomusicology; Theorizing Radio and Musical Identities; Critical Historiography; Music and Affect; Proseminar in Creative Practice; Scholarly Writing for Publication; and Arts of the Archive. Seminars offered in other departments—for instance, in visual arts, literature, theatre and dance, anthropology, communication, ethnic studies, cognitive science, psychology, or computer science—are encouraged and may fulfill degree requirements, if approved by a student&rsquo;s faculty adviser.</p>
				<p>The integrative studies program embraces multiple ways of knowing and encourages cross-fertilization and hybridity between diverse disciplines and musical forms. Faculty and students in integrative studies produce work that moves fluidly between scholarship, performance, improvisation, sound installation, composition, instrument building, and more. The program teaches students to situate knowledge and practices from local to global communities, and to produce compelling scholarly writing and creative work that recognizes the responsibilities and opportunities associated with living in an increasingly interconnected and interdependent world.</p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Performance </h3>
				<p><a href="http://musicweb.ucsd.edu/grad/grad-pages.php?i=204" target="_blank">http://musicweb.ucsd.edu/grad/grad-pages.php?i=204</a></p>
				<p>Fostering the creative, intelligent, and passionate performance of contemporary music is the mission of the Performance Program of the Department of Music. As once stated by founding faculty composer Robert Erickson, we at UC San Diego are a “community of musicians.” </p>
				<p>Performers act and interact in a communal environment by means of collaboration
				  with faculty and student composers, research in the areas of
				  new performance modalities, music technology, and improvisation,
				  among many other pursuits. The performance of contemporary
				  music is viewed as a creative act that balances expertise and exploration. </p>
				<p>Graduate performance students pursue either a master of arts or a doctor of musical arts degree in contemporary music performance. The course of study for both programs involves the completion of required graduate seminars and intensive study with a mentoring faculty member. Students are encouraged to adopt a vigorous, exploratory orientation in their private study. Final degree requirements include a recital, or in the case of the DMA, two recitals and the presentation of personal performance research. </p>
				<p>The work of graduate performance students forms an integral component of a rich musical environment, which produces an astonishing quantity and variety of performances. Students may perform in collaborative performances with fellow students and faculty. Ensembles include groups specializing in the interpretation of unconventionally notated scores, the percussion group red fish blue fish and other ensembles. The Performance Forum, a student-initiated concert series, provides an opportunity for students to present a wide variety of repertoire that may include improvised music, world music, and music with technology. A strong, collaborative spirit among the curricular areas of the department (Performance, Composition, Music Technology, and Integrative Studies) also yields many new projects each year. Works by graduate student composers are performed on the annual Spring Festival and other concert series. The sense of musical community engendered by diverse interactions permeates the atmosphere and makes the Department of Music at UC San Diego a uniquely rewarding place to create the newest of music. </p>

<h2>Master&rsquo;s Degree Program<strong></strong></h2>
<p>The master&rsquo;s of arts (MA) in music includes areas of emphasis in composition, computer music, integrative studies, and performance. Students are expected to complete all degree requirements in six quarters of residence. The department does not grant duplicate or concurrent degrees. All MA students must make an appointment with the graduate adviser for a degree check no later than the winter quarter of the second year.</p>
<h3>Course Requirements </h3>
<p>In addition to completing the core graduate curriculum, all master&rsquo;s degree students must complete requirements in their area of emphasis:</p>
<h4>Composition</h4>
<ul>
 
    <li>MUS 203A-B-C—successful completion of the jury process is necessary to achieve a passing grade in the corresponding seminar.</li>
    <li>MUS 203D—every quarter in residence with committee chair after the successful completion of 203C.</li>
    <li>MUS 210—must be taken twice (one time can count toward the depth core requirement).</li>
    <li>MUS 228</li>
    <li>MUS 229</li>
    <li>MUS 271A-B—both courses can count toward the depth requirement.</li>
  
</ul>
<h4>Computer Music </h4>
<ul>

    <li>MUS 270A-B-C—must take within the first year of the program.</li>
    <li>MUS 270D—required every quarter in residence when not enrolled in 270A-B-C.</li>

</ul>
<h4>Integrative Studies </h4>
<ul>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>MUS 215A-B-C</li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>MUS 215D—every quarter after successful completion of 215C until qualification.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Performance </h4>
<ul>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>MUS 200, 201, or 202—every quarter until graduation.</li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>MUS 232—every quarter in residence.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Master&rsquo;s Degree Completion Requirements </h3>
<ol>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Successful completion of the core curriculum and all curricular requirements of the student&rsquo;s area of emphasis for the master&rsquo;s degree.</li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Formation of a master&rsquo;s committee (see UC San Diego policy on appointment of the master&rsquo;s committee).</li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Submission of a substantive and polished research paper (which may have originated as a graduate seminar paper) to the student&rsquo;s MA committee for approval.</li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Students emphasizing composition must submit a folio of three chamber compositions (supplemented by audio or audio-visual recordings for at least two).</li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Students emphasizing computer music must submit a second substantive and polished research paper along with either a thesis demonstrating original research, or a lecture-performance in which the scientific, technological, and musical aspects of an original computer music composition are documented, played, and discussed.</li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Students emphasizing integrative studies must pass the preliminary examination and complete a thesis of roughly sixty pages demonstrating original research and critical insight, which may also include documentation of their creative practice. The purpose of the preliminary examination is to evaluate a student&rsquo;s command of content presented in the core integrative studies sequence (MUS 215A-B-C) and of scholarly research and writing conventions more broadly. Students take the preliminary examination at the end of the spring quarter of their first year. The exam consists of written responses to questions provided by the professors who taught in the core sequence during that same year. The exam duration is three hours and it is proctored electronically. After the exam, the participating professors provide written feedback evaluating a student&rsquo;s demonstrated proficiency and identifying any perceived shortcomings. If, in rare cases, those professors unanimously agree that the student has not passed the exam, then the student will not be allowed to continue in the program and will receive no further funding or support. In select cases, students may also be asked to repeat core course work, even if they received a passing grade, in order to continue in the program. The overriding purpose of the exam, however, is constructive rather than punitive.</li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Students emphasizing performance must present a major recital that merits approval by the student&rsquo;s committee chair and submit either two additional creative projects with accompanying documentation or one creative project plus a second research paper.</li>
</ol>
<p>All of the above master&rsquo;s requirements must have final approval from all members of a student&rsquo;s committee.</p>
<h2>Doctoral Degree Program</h2>
<p>The PhD program includes areas of emphasis in composition, computer music, and integrative studies. The doctor of musical arts (DMA) degree is in contemporary music performance. Successful completion of a master&rsquo;s degree—either at UC San Diego or including requirements equivalent to those of UC San Diego&rsquo;s MA in music—is required for admittance to the doctoral program. The department does not grant duplicate or concurrent degrees. All UC San Diego MA students must reapply for admittance to a doctoral program. UC San Diego MA students continuing to the PhD or DMA program must complete all departmental requirements, obtain Graduate Division approval, and file the MA degree at the University Central Library before enrolling in any PhD or DMA courses.</p>
<h3>Course Requirements </h3>
<p>In addition to the core graduate and PhD or DMA curriculum, doctoral students (according to their area of emphasis) must complete the following courses prior to the qualifying examination:</p>

Qualifying exams must be well supported with appropriate and proper citations and are most often in the range of twenty-five pages of written text for each question. Students have a twelve-day period in which to write the qualifying exam and must deliver copies of their responses to each committee member and to the graduate staff adviser within that twelve-day period. Final deliveries must be made on a regular UC San Diego workday, followed by a normative period of at least five workdays before the exam defense can be held, so please schedule accordingly. Students are advised to schedule an agreeable date and time for the exam with their committee members and then work backwards to arrive at an acceptable date for receiving their questions. For integrative studies students, one question will involve a defense of the student&rsquo;s dissertation prospectus. This prospectus is a document that presents the research topic of the dissertation, places it in the context of relevant literature and/or in the context of recent artistic developments, discusses its significance, specifies and justifies the research methods, theoretical orientation and/or artistic approach, and indicates the anticipated steps leading to completion.</li>
  <li>Successful completion of the qualifying exam marks the student&rsquo;s advancement to doctoral candidacy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>PhD and DMA Completion Requirements </h3>
<p>After successful completion of the qualifying examination, all students must remain in residence for at least three quarters, during which time they must enroll in twelve units of MUS 299 every quarter with their committee chair or other committee members. Students must provide a full copy of the doctoral research they wish to defend to the student&rsquo;s doctoral committee members four weeks prior to the doctoral defense. Materials previously submitted for other degrees are not acceptable, and in all cases a final public defense of the student&rsquo;s doctoral work is required. It is understood that the edition of the dissertation given to committee members will not be the final form, and that committee members may request changes or revisions be made to the text after the defense. In extreme cases, another public defense may be merited.</p>
<ul>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>For <em>composition </em>students, completion of a major composition project.</li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>For <em>computer music </em>students, completion of an acceptable dissertation.</li>

  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>For <em>integrative studies </em>students, completion of a book-length dissertation demonstrating original research and critical insight, or presentation of a major creative work and a substantive written defense of that work.</li>

  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>For DMA students, completion of two more recitals, or one recital plus one of the following: (a) a thesis or research project; (b) a concert or lecture recital that is innovative in design and/or content and which is supported by appropriate documentation as determined by the committee; or (c) two approved chamber music concerts, with appropriate documentation as determined by the committee.</li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>All of the above doctoral completion requirements must have final approval from all members of a student's committee. Acceptance of the dissertation by the university librarian represents the final step in completion of all requirements for the PhD.</li>
</ul>
<p>Materials previously submitted for other degrees are not acceptable for submission for the PhD and DMA.</p>
<h3>Specialization in Critical Gender Studies</h3>
<p>Students in the doctoral (PhD) program in music may apply for a specialization in critical gender studies to complement their course work and research in music. </p>
<p>The Critical Gender Studies Program is built on the intellectual foundations of intersectional feminist thought and queer studies, and incorporates the interdisciplinary methodologies, intersectional frameworks, and transformational epistemologies central to contemporary gender and sexuality studies. The graduate specialization in critical gender studies provides specialized training in gender and sexuality for students currently enrolled in a UC San Diego doctoral (PhD) program. Through advanced course work in critical gender studies and its affiliated departments,&nbsp;graduate students in the specialization develop an understanding of gender as necessarily linked to other social formations, including sexuality, race, nation, religion, (dis)ability, and structures of capital.&nbsp;At the same time,&nbsp;doctoral&nbsp;(PhD) students engaging&nbsp;gender and sexuality studies&nbsp;have the opportunity to develop their work among peers who take up similar questions in their scholarship.</p>
<p>Admitted students are required to complete five courses in addition to their home department&rsquo;s core requirements, consisting of two core courses and three electives. The core courses are Advanced Studies in Critical Gender Studies (CGS 200), to be taken shortly after admission to the specialization, and Practicum in Critical Gender Studies (CGS 299), to be taken in the student&rsquo;s final two years of dissertation writing. Electives may be chosen from a list of preapproved seminars in participating departments (students may petition other courses with significant gender/sexuality studies content) and may be taken at any time during the student&rsquo;s tenure at UC San Diego. Admitted students must also include at least one member of their dissertation committee from the list of CGS core or affiliate faculty.</p>
