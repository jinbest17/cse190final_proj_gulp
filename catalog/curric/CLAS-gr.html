  Program in Classics
</h3>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">UC Irvine, UC Riverside, and UC San
	    Diego </h4>
				<p><span class="strong">What is the UC Tri-Campus Program? </span>This graduate program joins together into a single faculty more than twenty experts in classics and related disciplines from the three southernmost University of California campuses (Irvine, Riverside, and San Diego). It features an innovative curriculum and program of study that address the practical and theoretical questions confronting the humanities and classics in particular as both enter the twenty-first century. </p>
				<p class="basic-offset-top-only"><span class="strong">What are the program&#8217;s goals?</span> The aim of the Tri-Campus Program is to provide an educational environment for pursuing a graduate career in classics that is closely integrated into the main currents of humanistic and social scientific scholarship. The program&#8217;s faculty recognizes that today and in the future, teachers of the classics must possess and develop expertise beyond the standard specialties of the traditional classics PhD degree. Classics programs, in both large research universities and small liberal arts colleges, increasingly feel the pressure to break down the boundaries between disciplines. </p>
				<p>To achieve these goals, the program and curriculum are designed around five principles: </p>
				<ul>
					<li class="list-level-1">Study the ancient texts and objects in their wider social, cultural, and historical contexts. </li>
					<li class="list-level-1">Bring the culture of the ancient Greeks and Romans into the purview of contemporary literary and sociological theory. </li>
					<li class="list-level-1">Examine the reception of ancient literature and culture by later cultures and the appropriation of the ancient world by the modern world. </li>
					<li class="list-level-1">Pay particular attention to the intersections of Greek and Roman society and culture with each other and with the other cultures of the ancient world. </li>
					<li class="list-level-1">Utilize, to the fullest the potential, new computing technologies as tools for research and teaching. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>These five interdisciplinary principles are embodied in the four Core Courses (Classics 200A, 200B, 200C, and 201). Graduate seminars (Classics 220) and reading courses in Greek and Latin authors (Classics 205) round out the program of studies. This curriculum has been in effect at UC Irvine since 1995, taught by faculty members from all three campuses. </p>
				<p class="basic-offset-top-only"><span class="strong">Where do I apply? </span>The Tri-Campus Program uniquely does not belong to a particular campus but to the University of California. Students who are accepted into the program may enroll at any of the three campuses. Because instruction and administrative functions take place on the Irvine campus, students will normally enroll at UC Irvine. Applications to the Tri-Campus Graduate Program will be reviewed by an admissions committee composed of members from all three campuses. </p>
				<p class="basic-offset-top-only"><span class="strong">Where is the Tri-Campus
				    Program located?</span> UC Irvine is located five miles inland from the
				    Pacific Ocean, fifty miles south of metropolitan Los Angeles,
				    forty-five miles southwest of UC Riverside, and seventy-four
				    miles north of UC San Diego. In addition to its beaches,
				    mountains, and deserts, Southern California offers excellent cultural
				    amenities such as museums, theatre, dance, opera, and music. </p>
				<p class="basic-offset-top-only"><span class="strong">What are the requirements for admission?</span> Applicants to the program should have a BA or equivalent in classics or classical civilization, which normally means that you have had at least three years of one classical language and two of the other. Majors in other disciplines (e.g., comparative literature, history, philosophy, or interdisciplinary fields such as women&#8217;s studies) are welcome, provided they have sufficient background in Greek and Latin. All applicants must submit Graduate Record Exam (GRE) scores and must have a minimum GPA of 3.0 or the equivalent. If you have completed an MA in classics at another institution, you may be admitted with advanced standing and may have the course requirements reduced from the normal three years to two or one. The level of course reduction will be determined by progress evaluation exams administered in the spring quarter of each year. </p>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">The Role of the Joint Executive Committee </h4>
				<p>The Tri-Campus Program is administered by a joint executive committee (JEC), which consists of six representatives, two from each campus, serving staggered, two-year terms. The JEC&#8217;s responsibilities include reviewing graduate applications and admitting students to the program; overseeing the formation of examination and dissertation committees; reviewing and deciding on student petitions; making policy decisions concerning the program, including changes in the program&#8217;s requirements and procedures; and interpreting the program&#8217;s requirements and procedures. The JEC elects from its members a chair to serve a three-year term. It is the chair&#8217;s responsibility to manage budgetary issues, schedule and set the agenda for quarterly JEC meetings, identify faculty to teach graduate courses, and generally look after the smooth operation of the program. </p>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">The Role of the Graduate Adviser </h4>
				<p>The graduate adviser is a faculty member responsible for supervising graduate study in the department and monitoring the academic progress of graduate students. The graduate adviser coordinates the various elements of the academic program and advises students and other faculty members about program requirements and university policies. The graduate adviser keeps records for each student and for the whole program, ensures that each student meets all requirements and makes satisfactory progress toward attainment of the degree, and is instrumental in the nomination of students for fellowship support and assistantship appointments. The graduate adviser also provides general help to students as they attempt to negotiate the academic and administrative hurdles on their way to completion of their degrees. The graduate adviser is an ex-officio member of the Tri-Campus JEC for the duration of his or her tenure, normally two years. </p>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Election of Student Representative </h4>
				<p>Graduate students elect a representative who attends JEC meetings as a regular voting member. Graduate students are also invited to attend meetings as observers and to participate where appropriate. The voting rights and attendance of the graduate student representative are circumscribed by the requirements of confidentiality. </p>
				<p class="anchor-parent"><a class="anchor" id="grad"></a></p><h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">The PhD
			    and the MA Programs </h2>
				<p>A student&#8217;s career may be thought of as covering three stages: course work, preparation for qualifying exams, and candidacy (dissertation). For PhD students the normative limits for completion of the program are four years to advancement to candidacy, two years to final approval of the dissertation, and a maximum of seven years in total. Students are only admitted into the PhD program. Entering students who do not already hold a master&#8217;s degree in classics from another institution will be required to complete MA requirements while pursuing the PhD. </p>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Course Work for the MA</h3>
				<p>The MA degree in classics may be awarded either upon completing the PhD course requirements and passing the written PhD examinations or upon completing the MA course requirements and master&#8217;s paper and passing the MA translation examinations and general exam. The latter path to the MA is intended for PhD students who decide to leave the program before completing the requirements for a PhD.</p>
				<p>MA students must successfully complete a minimum of twelve approved seminar-level courses. The twelve courses must be distributed as follows: </p>
				<ul>
					<li class="list-level-1">Nine quarters of Classics 220. </li>
					<li class="list-level-1">At least three quarters of Classics 200A-B-C and 201; a fourth quarter may be substituted for a Classics 220. </li>
					<li class="list-level-1">Up to one quarter of Classics 290 for research and writing of the master&#8217;s paper may be substituted for a Classics 220. </li>
					<li class="list-level-1">If remedial work is required in Greek or Latin, with the graduate adviser&#8217;s approval, one enhanced upper-division Greek or Latin course enrolled as a Classics 280 may be substituted for a Classics 220. </li>
					<li class="list-level-1">With the graduate adviser&#8217;s approval, MA students may substitute one external graduate seminar in a relevant area outside of classics (at any of the three participating campuses) for a Classics 220. </li>
				</ul>

		<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Course Work for the PhD </h3>
				<p>PhD students must successfully complete a minimum of eighteen approved seminar-level courses. The eighteen courses must be distributed as follows: </p>
				<ul>
					<li class="list-level-1">Four quarters of Classics 200A-B-C, and 201. </li>
					<li class="list-level-1">Twelve quarters of Classics 220. </li>
					<li class="list-level-1">Two external graduate seminars, from departments or programs outside of classics. These may be taken from the offerings of any of the three campuses. </li>
					<li class="list-level-1">Students may take up to two quarters of enhanced upper-division Greek or Latin courses (enrolled as 280s) in place of Classics 220s, with permission of the graduate adviser if remedial work is required in Greek or Latin. </li>
					<li class="list-level-1">Where appropriate, in the third year of course work, a second Classics 200A, B, or C, may be substituted for a 220.</li>
					<li class="list-level-1">Classics 280, Independent Study (supervised research) may be substituted for Classics 220s only with the permission of the graduate adviser. </li>
					<li class="list-level-1">Up to twelve equivalent graduate-level courses completed elsewhere may be substituted for Tri-Campus Program courses with approval of the JEC. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>Classics 280 may be used, normally in the fourth year, to provide time to work on the Greek and Latin reading lists and to prepare for qualifying exams, but these courses do not count toward the required eighteen courses. PhD students must meet with the graduate adviser early every fall quarter to discuss their progress through the curriculum and their plans for the coming academic year. A student who accumulates more than one outstanding grade of incomplete is considered to be at risk. </p>
				<p>For student files, faculty teaching graduate courses will submit to the graduate adviser a brief written evaluation for each student, commenting on the student&#8217;s performance and noting whether the student wrote a seminar paper for the course. The graduate adviser will lead the JEC in an annual review of all active graduate students in the program at the JEC&#8217;s spring meeting. </p>

<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Examinations </h3>
				<p>Diagnostic Exams: Immediately upon entering the program, the student takes diagnostic translation examinations in both Greek and Latin to establish his or her level of competency and to determine where effort should be directed. In the second year of course work, students will take as diagnostic exams the Latin and Greek translation exams administered as part of the qualifying exam battery. </p>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Exams for the MA </h4>
				<p class="list-level-1-numerical"><span class="strong">Foreign Language Requirement: </span>Students must demonstrate reading knowledge of German, French, Italian, or an equivalent research language either through appropriate course work or by examination. </p>
				<p class="list-level-1-numerical"><span class="strong">Translation Exams:</span> Each student must pass a set of translation examinations in Greek and in Latin administered by the master&#8217;s committee (two hours each). </p>
				<p>The JEC, in consultation with the graduate adviser and the student, recommends to the graduate dean a three-member master&#8217;s committee composed of program faculty from at least two campuses to set and evaluate the translation exams and to evaluate the master&#8217;s paper. Normally this committee is established in the quarter preceding completion of the master&#8217;s paper. </p>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Exams for the PhD </h4>
				<ol>
				  <li><span class="strong">Foreign Language Requirements: </span>PhD
				    students must demonstrate reading proficiency in one modern
				    research language (normally German, French, or Italian) by the end of
				    their second year either through appropriate course work or by examination.
				    Proficiency in a second modern research language is expected by the end
				    of the third year. </li>
				  <li><span class="strong">PhD Qualifying Exams:</span> In order to
				    advance to candidacy for the PhD and to enter the dissertation
				    stage, a student must pass a set of seven qualifying exams. The translation
				    exams, history exams, and history of the literatures exam
				    are administered and evaluated on a regular schedule over the academic
				    year by examination boards composed of one faculty member from each campus
				    and appointed for that purpose by the JEC at the graduate adviser&#8217;s
				    recommendation. The JEC, in consultation with the graduate adviser and
				    the student, recommends to the graduate dean a five-member candidacy
				    committee composed of four program faculty (from at least two campuses)
				    and one outside member holding tenure on one of the participating campuses
				    (i.e., not a member of the program faculty) to organize and administer
				    the special-area exam and the oral exam taken by the candidate after
				    successful completion of the other exams. All committee members for both
				    candidacy and doctoral committees should normally be voting members of
				    the Academic Senate of the Irvine, Riverside, or San Diego divisions.
				    Any exceptions must hold a PhD, be qualified for a UC faculty appointment,
				    and be supported by a memo of justification and a CV submitted by the
				    graduate adviser to the graduate dean for approval at least two weeks
				    prior to an exam. The qualifying examinations include written examinations
				    and a final oral examination: 
				  <ol class="lower-alpha"><li>Greek and Latin translation (three hours each) </li>
				  <li>Greek and Roman history (two hours each) </li>
				  <li>History of Greek and Roman literature (three hours) </li>
				  <li>A “special area” that can be fulfilled by either an extensive research
				    paper or a three-hour written exam </li>
				  <li>Oral examination to be administered by the candidacy committee and
				    taken only after the other exams have been passed (two hours: one hour
				    general knowledge and one hour special-area exam paper or research paper) </li></ol>
				  These exams are based on the Tri-Campus Reading Lists and should be
				    completed by the end of the fourth year. The exams on Greek and Roman
				    history are based on up to six books each, three prescribed on the reading
				    list for this exam and up to three agreed to by the student and graduate
				    adviser. The exam on the history of Greek and Roman literature is based
				    on the Greek and Latin Reading Lists and the books prescribed on the
				    reading list for this exam. Students are expected to read, in the original,
				    all works on the Greek and Latin Reading Lists, whether or not they have
				    appeared in courses. (Students may negotiate with the graduate adviser
				    substitutions on the Greek and Latin Reading Lists comprising up to twenty
				    percent of their total length in order to accommodate the particular
				    interests of the individual student.) Upon successful completion of the
				    written examinations, the oral exam will be scheduled. Students failing
				    segments of the qualifying exams may normally retake those sections only
				    once after the interval of one quarter or the summer break, as the case
				    may be. Students may retake segments of the qualifying exams more than
				    once only at the discretion of the JEC. A grade of Pass in all examinations
				    is required for admission to candidacy. </li>
	    </ol>
<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Thesis and Defense for the MA </h4>
				<p>The master&#8217;s paper comprises a substantial piece of original research. It should exceed the breadth and depth expected for a seminar paper, which can provide a good foundation for the master&#8217;s paper. The master&#8217;s paper must be submitted to members of the master&#8217;s committee three weeks in advance of the general exam.</p>
				<p>If the master&#8217;s paper is found to be of passing quality by the committee, the student may take the general exam, a one-hour oral exam covering the broader implications of the master&#8217;s paper and the classical world generally. </p>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Thesis and Defense for the PhD </h4>
				<p>When the student has advanced to candidacy, the JEC—in consultation with the candidate, the graduate adviser, and the proposed chair of the doctoral committee—will recommend to the dean of the Graduate Division a doctoral committee composed of at least three program faculty (from at least two of the three campuses) and one outside member who holds tenure at one of the participating campuses. The doctoral committee will serve as the examination committee for the thesis defense. Within the first quarter after completion of the qualifying exams and all other prerequisites, the candidate will submit a dissertation proposal for discussion and evaluation to the doctoral committee. </p>
				<p>A public oral defense of the dissertation will be scheduled upon its submission to the doctoral committee. Members of the committee must be supplied with a copy of the dissertation at least three weeks before the exam date. </p>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">The Emphasis in Comparative Literature </h3>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Course Work </h4>
				<p>For the emphasis in comparative literature, students must take at least five graduate courses in the Department of English and Comparative Literature. One course should be Criticism 222A or C, or Comparative Literature 200. At least three of the courses should have a Comparative Literature designation. One of the courses could be Humanities 270 (Critical Theory). Classics students can devote the required outside seminars to this emphasis and may, with the graduate adviser&#8217;s approval, make appropriate substitutions of courses. </p>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Qualifying Exams </h4>
				<p>One topic on the PhD qualifying examination must be on a comparative literature topic and should be prepared with a professor from the Comparative Literature Program who would serve as a member of the student&#8217;s exam committee. The student should be able to demonstrate some expertise in comparative critical methodologies as well as knowledge of a literature and tradition other than classics. Normally classics students will fulfill this requirement by selecting the research-paper option for the oral-exam stage of the qualifying examinations. </p>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Dissertation </h4>
				<p>One member of the student&#8217;s doctoral committee must be from the Program in Comparative Literature.</p>
				<p>Students must submit an application for the emphasis to the graduate adviser in classics, and the department will track the students&#8217; progress and fulfillment of the emphasis requirements. Upon graduation, students will receive a letter from the graduate adviser certifying completion of the emphasis. </p>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Attendance at Colloquia and other Departmental Activities </h3>
				<p>Seminars, colloquia, and other activities of interest to classics graduate students are organized regularly by the Tri-Campus Graduate Program. Since these activities are considered part of the student&#8217;s professional training, all students are required to attend them. Students are also urged to acquaint themselves with colloquia offered in other fields. </p>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Support for Graduate Students </h3>
				<p>A variety of fellowships and teaching assistantships is available to classics graduate students on a competitive basis. They include Chancellor&#8217;s Fellowships, Regents&#8217; Fellowships, and Dissertation Fellowships, as well as the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae Fellowship. Several teaching and research assistantships are also available and provide a stipend in addition to tuition and fees. Some fourth- and fifth-year teaching assistantships are held at UC Riverside and UC San Diego. Continuation of support is contingent upon satisfactory academic progress. Support from various sources is normally extended to students in good standing for up to six years. </p>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Resources of the Tri-Campus Program </h3>
