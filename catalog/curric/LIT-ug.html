<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p>The Department of Literature at UC San Diego is unique both
                  conceptually and structurally in that it combines all literary
                  study in a single department, enabling students to concentrate
                  on single-language or national literatures, while at the same
                  time facilitating student engagement in dialogue across literatures
                  and languages. The department also houses undergraduate and
                  graduate study in the craft and theory of creative writing. The
                  department brings together writers, teachers, scholars, and
                  students of several different languages and literatures, uniting
                  them by the nature of the studies they pursue. This lends a
                  comparative aspect to both undergraduate and graduate programs,
                  which lead to the bachelor of arts, master of fine arts, the
                  candidate in philosophy, and doctor of philosophy degrees. All literature students require knowledge of a second language. Courses are offered not only in the literatures themselves but also in the theoretical aspects of literature and—often in cooperation with other departments—in the relationship of literary study to other disciplines such as philosophy, visual arts, music, sociology, history, psychology, linguistics, and communication.  With special permission, undergraduates
                  may take graduate courses for credit, and graduate students
                  may also take undergraduate courses for credit.				</p>
        <p>The Mandeville Special Collections Library, located in the Geisel Library, offers the undergraduate and graduate literature student an excellent range of resources, including single-author collections, rare and out-of-print books, tapes, maps, and historical archives. Of special interest are the Southworth Collection of Spanish Civil War materials, the Hill Collection of South Pacific Voyages, the Don Cameron Allen Renaissance collection, and the Archive for New Poetry. Within the latter collection are an extensive series of single-author archives, including the papers of Paul Blackburn, Donald Allen, Lew Welch, Charles Reznikoff, Joanne Kyger, Jerome Rothenberg, and others. The Archive for New Poetry is one of the largest collections of contemporary poetry in the United States. Graduate students also have access, facilitated by travel grants, to all other University of California research collections.</p>

<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Careers for Literature Majors </h3>
				<p>Literature majors develop skills and perspectives that prepare them for
				  careers in education and numerous other professions. The writing, analytical,
				  and cultural breadth of majors makes them attractive as preparation for
				  professional schools as well as advanced graduate studies. A degree in
				  literature provides a strong background for the LSAT and law school. Medical
				  schools seek out students who are prepared not only in the sciences, but
				  also in the humanities and writing. The business world seeks college-trained
				  English majors, and international corporations actively recruit students
				  with a specialty in French, German, Italian, Russian, or Spanish. Literature
				  majors’ skills also prepare them for work in advertising, editing, publishing,
				  journalism, communications, mass media, and other professions where writers
				  and editors are in demand. The knowledge of a second language and culture
			    provides literature majors with a decided career advantage. </p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Secondary School English Teaching </h3>
				<p>The literature department offers an excellent preparation for teaching English/ESL in secondary schools. Suggested majors include World Literature and Culture, Literatures in English, and Literature/Writing. If you are interested in receiving a California teaching credential from UC San Diego, contact <a href="EDS-ug.html">Education Studies</a> (EDS) for information about prerequisites and professional preparation requirements. Please consult EDS and the Department of Literature early in your academic career to plan an appropriate literature curriculum. </p>
<h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">The Undergraduate Program </h2>
		<p class="anchor-parent"><a class="anchor" id="major"></a></p><h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">The Major in Literature </h3>
				<p>There are four majors available to students within the Department of Literature: Literatures in English, Literatures in Spanish, World Literature and Culture, and Literature/Writing.  Requirements vary from major to major as described below. Once a student has decided upon a major in literature, he or she is required to meet regularly with an adviser in the Department of Literature. Worksheets defining major requirements are available in the literature undergraduate office to help students organize their course work. </p>
				<p>All departmental courses taken to satisfy the requirements of the literature major, including courses in the secondary literature, must be taken for a letter grade. No grade below C– is acceptable for a course taken in the major. </p>
				<p>At least six of the upper-division courses for the major, including a minimum of four in the primary literature, must be taken at UC San Diego. </p>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Lower-Division Preparation </h4>
				<p>Lower-division requirements vary, depending on the literature major in which the student elects to concentrate. However, the department strongly recommends that, as part of the freshman/sophomore course work, students who have chosen or are considering a major in literature begin an appropriate lower-division language sequence in the Departments of Linguistics or Literature. All literature majors require knowledge of a second language.</p>
				
        <p class="anchor-parent"><a class="anchor" id="secondary"></a></p><h4>Secondary Language and Literature</h4>
				<em>In order to broaden their preparation, all students in literature must undertake study of a secondary language.</em> The range of languages includes ASL, French, German, Classical Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Latin, Russian, and Spanish. For those concentrating in Literatures in Spanish, English is also an option.  Students will satisfy this requirement by completing the lower-division course sequence in a second language, through the designated terminal lower-division course in that language as outlined below. Students should consult an adviser to confirm the selection of the specific courses that will be taken to satisfy the secondary language and literature requirement.</p>
		<p>The terminal course for each secondary language is as follows: American Sign Language 1E; French (LTFR) 50; German (LTGM) 2C; Hebrew (JUDA) 3 (see &ldquo;<a href="JWSP-ug.html">Jewish Studies</a>&rdquo;); Italian (LTIT) 50; Greek (LTGK) 3; Latin (LTLA) 3; Russian (LTRU) 2B; Spanish (LTSP), choice of 50A, 50B, or 50C. For literatures in Spanish majors,  English (LTEN), choice of 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, or 29. Alternative secondary languages are subject to approval and petition.</p>
		<h4>Intensive Track Option</h4>
        <p>The department also offers an<em> intensive</em> secondary language and literature track, which will be noted on the student&rsquo;s transcript. This track is encouraged for students who intend to attend graduate school or are interested in international careers. In addition to the secondary language requirements above, students in the intensive track will complete at least two upper-division literature courses taught in the language used to fulfill their secondary language requirement. Students should consult with the faculty adviser for that language when choosing their upper-division course for the intensive track.</p>
        <h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Writing Component in Literature Courses </h4>
				<p>It is the departmental expectation that students in lower-division courses will write a minimum of 2,500 words per course. In upper-division courses the minimum requirement is 4,000 words per course.</p>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Honors Program </h4>
				<p>The department offers a special program of advanced study for outstanding undergraduates majoring in literature. Admission to this program requires an overall GPA of 3.5, a literature major GPA of 3.7, and enrollment in one of the literature capstone courses (LTWR 194 for writing majors and LTWL 194 for all other majors) at the beginning of the senior year. During fall quarter, students meeting these requirements will be invited to participate in the Honors Program. Interested students who anticipate that they will not meet the established criteria may petition to participate in the program. During the winter quarter of their senior year, all honors students will write their theses (LT__ 196), under the supervision of a faculty member who specializes in the literature of the student&rsquo;s primary concentration. The Honors Program concludes with each student presenting his or her thesis at the Honors Program conference (within the department). Students from this program will also be recommended for the Burckhardt and Williams Prizes, which are awarded for outstanding achievement in the literature major. The capstone course and thesis course may be applied toward the primary concentration in the literature major, if applicable.</p>
<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Special Studies </h4>
				<p>These upper-division independent study opportunities are intended for advanced students, able to work on their own, and interested in a topic not normally covered by departmental offerings. </p>
				<p>Students with upper-division standing, a departmental GPA of at least 3.0, an overall GPA of at least 2.5, and completion of lower-division prerequisites in the subject, are eligible to take special studies courses (198s and 199s). Those not satisfying these criteria may, with justification supported by the proposed special studies instructor, petition for an exception to the regulation. 198s and 199s require at least 4,000 words of writing or an equivalent project as determined by the instructor. Information and Special Studies Enrollment forms are available in the literature undergraduate office. Enrollment requires departmental approval. Special studies courses may not be taken for a grade. These courses may not be used to satisfy upper-division requirements for majors or minors. </p>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Study Abroad </h4>
				<p>Study abroad can significantly enhance a student&#8217;s major, particularly in ways in which it relates to international issues. Literature students are encouraged to study abroad before their senior year. Students who take Education Abroad Program or Opportunities Abroad Program (EAP/OAP) courses in a country appropriate to their major may use up to five upper-division courses to satisfy major requirements and up to three toward a minor. These must be approved by the department after they have been entered on the student&#8217;s official record at UC San Diego. The approval process is described in a handout on receiving transfer credit, available in the Literature Undergraduate Office. Before leaving to study abroad, students should meet with an adviser to identify which EAP courses are appropriate to fulfill the major or minor requirements. </p>
				<p>Information on EAP/OAP is given in the “<a href="EAP.html">Education Abroad
				    Program</a>” section of the <span class="italic">UC San Diego General
				    Catalog</span>.
Interested students should contact the Study Abroad UC San Diego Office in the International
Center and visit its website at <a href="http://studyabroad.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">http://studyabroad.ucsd.edu/</a>.
Financial aid can be used for EAP/OAP study, and special study-abroad scholarships
are also available. </p>

                <h4 class="program-overview-subhead-4"><span class="anchor-parent">Literatures in Spanish Major</span></h4>
				<ol>
				  <li>Two lower-division Spanish literature courses from below: </li>
				  <ol class="lower-alpha">
				    <li>LTSP 50A. Peninsular Literature </li>
				  <li> LTSP 50B. Latin American Literature </li>
				  <li>LTSP 50C. Latin American Literature</li>
				  </ol>
				  <li>Nine upper-division courses as follows: </li>
				  <ol class="lower-alpha">
				    <li>One course in Spanish Peninsular literature or Latin American literature before 1900, as follows:</li>
				    <ul>
                     
                        <li>Spanish       Peninsular literature LTSP 100, 107, 115, 119AB, 119C, 122, or the following       topics course when the topic is pre-twentieth-century literature: LTSP 123
                        
				    </li>
                       
                              <li>Latin American literature before 1900: LTSP 116, 135A, or any of the following regional, genre, or topics courses when the topic is pre-twentieth-century literature: LTSP 134, 136, 137, 138, 140, 141, 142, 171, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178</li>
				    </ul>
				    <li>Seven
				      additional upper-division courses in Spanish, Latin American,
				      and/or Chicano literature (taught in Spanish) </li>
				  </ol>
                  <li>At      least one course in a secondary language or literature; that is, a course      taught in a language other than Spanish. See &ldquo;<a href="#secondary">Secondary      Language and Literature</a>&rdquo; above.</li>
		
                  <li>Upper-division electives from Department of Literature offerings,
                    whether in Spanish or in another literature, to make a total
                    of twelve upper-division courses. </li>
                </ol>
<p>Students majoring in Spanish can choose to concentrate on either Spanish or Latin American literature. All students, however, are encouraged to take courses in the various national literatures as well as in Chicano literature for a broad background in Spanish language literatures. </p>
				<p>Students not having a solid linguistic base in Spanish are advised to take intermediate language courses from the LTSP 2 and 50 sequences for additional review of Spanish grammar, development of writing skills, and introduction to literary analysis. Only LTSP 50A and either 50B or 50C, however, can count toward the major.				</p>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">World Literature and Culture Major</h4>
				<p>World Literature and Culture allows students to design an intellectually rigorous plan of courses with the flexibility to explore multiple areas of interest. Four broad options are possible: 1) focus on a single non-Anglophone language, literature, and culture; 2) focus on literature and culture of a historical period prior to 1800; 3) focus on the literature and culture of a geographical region (for example, Europe, the Americas, East Asia, Africa, or the Near East); 4) focus on cultural production in a variety of media, including courses on film and television, digital media, and music, as well as courses on the history of the book and translation. </p>
				<p>In all of its variants, the World Literature and Culture major aims to provide students with broad cultural literacy and critical thinking skills—in language, literature, visual media, social practices, and theories of interpretation—which are basic, necessary cornerstones of a humanities education. The undergraduate major in World Literature and Culture seeks to develop literacy in a range of traditional and modern cultural forms (literature, film, and the visual arts) and methods for interpreting these cultural forms in a way that will prepare students to engage with a society whose literature and culture is, and will become increasingly, diverse, international, and multilingual.</p>
<ol>
    <li>
      <p>Lower division (three courses):<br>
      </p>
      <p> All World Literature and Culture majors are required to complete a sequence of three lower-division courses.*  </p>
    <p>There are many ways to fulfill this requirement, including: </p>
    <p>
		LTCS 50, 52, and a third course selected from LTEN 25, 26, 27, 28, 29; LTWL 4A-B-C-D-F-M; TWS 21-22-23-24-25-26; or LTWL 19A-B-C.</p>
  <p>
  Or: a three-course sequence in literature chosen from any section in literature. For example, students can take a yearlong sequence of intermediate language courses: LTFR 2A-B-C or 50; LTGM 2A-B-C; LTGK 1, 2, 3; LTIT 2A-B, 50; LTKO 2A-B-C; LTLA 1, 2, 3; LTRU 2A-B; LTSP 2A-B-C and/or LTSP 50A-B-C.  </p>
  <p>
  Students can also combine courses in an original national language/literature with courses in translation to satisfy this requirement, such as LTFR 2A-B plus LTWL 4A (Film and Fiction in Twentieth-Century Societies: French).</p>
  <p>
  Students may also use either the Revelle College Humanities sequence (HUM 1–5), Eleanor Roosevelt College&rsquo;s Making of the Modern World (MMW 1–6), Marshall College&rsquo;s Dimension of Culture (DOC 1–3), or Sixth College&rsquo;s Culture, Art, and Technology sequence (CAT 1–3) to satisfy the lower-division sequence for the World Literature and Culture major.</p>

<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Literature/Writing Major</h4>
				<p>The writing major is designed to provide direct experience in writing fiction, nonfiction, and poetry as well as engage the student writer in both the world of “writing culture”—public readings, publication, and the media—and literary theory and practical critique. An indispensable feature of this program is that it engages students with one another&#8217;s
				  work, both critically and communally. Writing majors will move through
				  a sequence of courses within (and between) genres in order to develop their
				  own style and confidence in the work of writing and critique. Students
				  who are interested in teaching writing will find this major an opportunity
				  both for writing extensively and dealing critically with the act of written
			    composition. The major requirements are as follows: </p>
				<ol>
			      <li>LTWR 8A, 8B, and 8C.</li>
                  <li>Three lower-division courses:</li>

                    </ol>
                    <li>Twelve upper-division courses: </li>
                    <ol start="1" type="1" class="lower-alpha">
                      <li>Six upper-division courses in Literature/Writing from
                        the writing workshop sequence (LTWR 100–129). These workshops
                        may be repeated for credit (see course listing for number
                        of times workshops may be repeated), but the requirement
                        should show a range of writing experience in at least
                        two major writing types. No other courses may be substituted
                        for this basic requirement of six upper-division workshops. </li>
                      <li>One course from the group numbered LTWR 140–148. </li>

		</ol>
<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Double Major within the Department of Literature in Literature/Writing and Another Literature </h4>
				<p>Students who wish to major both in Literature/Writing and in literature (any section) should see the department for information regarding appropriate double major requirements. Generally, all requirements for each major must be completed, though the secondary language and literature course(s) and two upper-division courses, where appropriate, may overlap from one major to the other.  </p>
				<p>Students must submit a double major petition for approval by the department and the student&#8217;s provost office. </p>
	<p class="anchor-parent"><a class="anchor" id="minor"></a></p><h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">The Minor in Literature</h3>
				<p>The department offers a wide range of possibilities for noncontiguous minors. The options include courses in a single regional or national literature, courses in more than one literature, and a combination of language and literature courses. The minors require seven courses. <em>All courses taken to complete a literature minor must be taken for a letter grade. </em>No grade below C– is acceptable. Advanced Placement (AP) credit will not satisfy minor requirements.</p>
				<p>Please see the department undergraduate office for specific minor requirements. </p>
				<ul>
					<li class="list-level-1">A minor in literature will consist of seven courses as described below. </li>
					<li class="list-level-1">French, German, Greek, Italian, Latin, Russian, or Spanish literature: seven courses, at least four of which must be upper-division in the same literature. </li>
				  <li class="list-level-1">Literatures in English, Literatures of the World, and Literature/Writing: seven courses, at least five of which must be upper division. </li>
					<li class="list-level-1">
					  <p>Lower-division courses applicable toward minors: </p>
					</li>
				
				<p>English—LTEN 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29</p>
				<p>French—LTFR 2A-B-C, 50</p>
				<p>German—LTGM 2A-B-C</p>

				<p>Writing—LTWR 8A-B-C </p></ul>
				<p>Literatures of the World—seven literature courses, at least five of which must be upper division—usually 1) a two- or three-course lower-division sequence and 2) five upper-division courses with a single unifying theme. Students may use either the Revelle College Humanities sequence (HUM 1–5) or Eleanor Roosevelt College&#8217;s Making of the Modern World (MMW 11–15) to satisfy the lower-division sequence for the LTWL minor. </p>
		<p>Writing minor—seven courses, at least five of which must be upper division. The minimum of five upper-division courses must cover at least two major writing genres, with course work chosen from writing courses (LTWR) numbered 100 through 148. </p>
