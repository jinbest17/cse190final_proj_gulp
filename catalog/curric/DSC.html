		<p class="sectionNav"><span class="courseFacLink">[ <a href="../faculty/DSC.html">faculty</a> | <a href="../courses/DSC.html">courses</a> ]</span></p><!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Curriculum Listing.lbi" -->
<p><em>All courses, faculty listings, and curricular and degree requirements described herein are subject to change or deletion without notice. </em></p>
<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><h2>Program Focus</h2>
          <p>Data science is concerned with drawing useful and valid conclusions from data. Data scientists develop mathematical models, computational methods, and tools for exploring, analyzing, and making predictions from data. They ask appropriate questions about data and interpret the predictions based on their expertise of the subject domain.</p>
        <p>The primary goal for the data science major is to train a generation of students who are equally versed in predictive modeling, data analysis, and computational techniques. To this end, in addition to learning about data science models and methods, students will acquire expertise in a particular subject domain. The major also educates students about the societal impact of data science so that they can make responsible decisions as data science practitioners. </p>
          <h2>Majors in Data Science</h2>
          <p>The major consists of 116 units with fifty-six units from lower-division courses and sixty units from upper-division courses. The lower-division curriculum includes calculus and linear algebra courses for sixteen units, data science courses for twenty-eight units, and subject domain courses for twelve units. The program includes twenty units of elective courses that will enable students to embark upon an in-depth exploration of one or more areas in which data science can profitably be applied. Alternatively, students can choose to explore the mathematical, statistical, and computational foundations of data science in even greater depth.          </p>
          <p>All majors will be required to undertake a senior project that will give them an opportunity to creatively synthesize much of what they have learned in the data science courses for addressing problems in chosen domains. </p>
          <h3>Lower Division</h3>
          <p>Students are expected to complete the following fifty-six units by the end of their sophomore year. All courses must be taken for a letter grade and passed with a minimum grade of C–. </p>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Data      Science: </em>COGS 9, DSC 10, DSC 20, DSC 30, DSC 40A-B, DSC 80 (twenty-eight      units)</li>

          <h2>Minor in Data Science </h2>
          <p>This minor is intended for students whose primary area of interest lies outside data science, but who are interested in acquiring competence in methods of data analysis. It requires completion of fifty-six units. Courses must be taken for a letter grade with a minimum passing grade of C–. Please be advised that DSC 40A and DSC 40B serve as prerequisites for required courses. DSC 40A-B can be taken for P/NP by data science minors.</p>

              <h2>Policies and Procedures for Data Science (DSC) Undergraduate Students</h2>
        <h3>Data Science Undergraduate Admissions</h3>
              <p>Because of the large number of students interested in data science and the limited resources available to accommodate this demand, the university has declared the data science major &ldquo;capped.&rdquo; This allows the Data Science Undergraduate Program to continue to offer the highest quality academic program to our students and avoid delays in time to degree due to lack of capacity in our courses.</p>
              <p>Admission directly into DSC is limited for freshmen effective fall 2018. Students will be selected by the UC San Diego Office of Undergraduate Admissions based on the students&rsquo; holistic review scores and availability of slots in the Data Science Undergraduate Program.</p>
              <p>Transfer applications will not be accepted until the fall 2019 application period for admission into the fall 2020 term. The first cohort of transfer students entering UC San Diego as data science majors is expected for fall 2020. Generally, we do not advise transfer students who have matriculated as a different major to attempt to switch into the data science major through the capped major application process. This is due to the additional screening process that would add to transfer students&rsquo; time to graduation, without a guarantee of acceptance into the major.</p>
<h3>Continuing Students</h3>
              <p>UC San Diego students who would like to change from another major into the Data Science Undergraduate Program may apply to the major via the capped major application. Applications will be accepted twice per year and must be submitted on or before the deadline. Please see the department website at <a href="http://dsc.ucsd.edu" target="_blank">http://dsc.ucsd.edu</a> for details.</p>
              <h4>Eligibility requirements:</h4>
              <ol start="1" type="1">
                <li>Successful      completion of twenty-four units (for letter grade) at UC San Diego (to      ensure that students are making progress toward their degree).</li>
                <li>Successful      completion of the screening courses for a letter grade: MATH 20C, MATH 18,      and DSC 10.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Courses       must be completed and/or in progress at the time of the capped major application       to be eligible.</li>
                  <li>Students       who pursue the honors version of MATH 18 and MATH 20C will also be       eligible for the capped major application.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Students      must apply by the end of their sixth academic quarter at UC San Diego.</li>

              <h4>Selection process:</h4>
              <ol>
                <ol>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Students will be ranked based on their GPA in the screening courses: MATH 20C, MATH 18, and DSC 10. Grades from transfer credit will be used in calculating the GPA for the screening courses.</li>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Students with the same GPA in the screening courses will be ordered by their overall GPA.</li>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Students will be admitted according to their ranking based on the number of available seats. If there are more students at a given rank than the available seats, random selection will be made from among the students at that rank to fill the remaining seats.</li>
