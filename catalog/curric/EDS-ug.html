  <p>A primary focus of the Education Studies Program is to provide equity of educational access for all students in public schools. This goal is actualized through the academic and field components of each of our programs. We require candidates to master the subject matter that they will teach and develop a repertoire of effective teaching practices that utilize their students’ cultural knowledge and language diversity as educational resources. </p>
<p class="anchor-parent"><a class="anchor" id="ugrad"></a></p><h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">Undergraduate Programs</h2>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Minors in Education Studies </h3>
				<p>The Education Studies Program offers three specific minor programs. These
				  minors are designed for students considering K–12 teaching
				  as a career; those interested in teaching at the college level;
				  and students who are interested in becoming better, more reflective learners.
				  The minor in Education Studies provides course work and field experience for students interested in elementary teaching, or for English, mathematics, science, engineering, or world language students who decide to pursue teaching during their junior or senior years. The Mathematics and Science Education minors explore
				  teaching and learning practices specific to these disciplines along with
				  the components of the knowledge base necessary to teach K–12 science and
				  mathematics successfully. All courses for these minors must be taken for
				  a letter grade except for EDS 39 and EDS 139. Depending on students&#8217; majors
				  and career plans, they may select from the following minor options: </p>
				<ul>
					<li class="list-level-1">Minor in Education Studies </li>
					<li class="list-level-1">Minor in Mathematics Education </li>
					<li class="list-level-1">Minor in Science Education </li>
				</ul>
				<h5 class="program-overview-subhead-4">Minor in Education Studies</h5>
				<p>Students must complete a minimum of one practicum course in Teaching and Learning (EDS 130, 131, 133, 135, 136, 137, 140, 141, 128AB, or 129ABC) and a minimum of one course from two of the remaining three categories of Learning Environments (EDS 110R, 111, 114, 115, 118, 119, 121A, 122, 124AR, or 124BR), Language and Culture (EDS 117 or 125), or School and Society (EDS 30, 31, 112, 113, 116, 125, or 126). All practicum courses, with the exception of EDS 135, require that students enroll concurrently in EDS 139.</p>
<p>Students planning to apply for the UC San Diego graduate credential program
				  must take specific courses in all four categories above (except
				  for the minor in Mathematics Education, and the minor in Science
				  Education). These two minors have their own specific courses,
				  described below. Please contact EDS for specific minor courses
				  that meet the prerequisite requirements for admission to the
				  graduate credential program. The EDS minor requires a minimum
				  of twelve units in EDS courses. A maximum of twelve units of
				  practicum (EDS 139) may be applied to this minor (minimum total of
				  twenty-eight quarter units). </p>

				<p class="basic-offset-top-only"><strong>Students interested in pursuing
				    a graduate teaching credential program at UC San Diego should contact EDS for
				    the specific prerequisite requirements for admission to the UC San Diego graduate
			    credential program. </strong></p>
				<h3>Bachelor of Science in Education Sciences: Transforming Education through Research and Practice</h3>
				<p>The bachelor of science in Education Sciences: Transforming Education through Research and Practice will provide you with opportunities to explore the complex social, psychological, economic, historical, political, and cultural issues that impact our lives. Our overarching mission is to provide the resources for students to combine interactive academic course work, hands-on service-learning experiences, and a deep understanding about the relationship between research and educational issues. Students will reflect deeply on underlying educational principles and gain the insight needed to become advocates for equity and social justice within our society. Students are guided to develop an understanding of research and theory within the realities of practice and to use practice to reevaluate both research and theory. </p>
				<p>The BS in Education Sciences provides interdisciplinary opportunities for undergraduate students. Students are prepared for careers in the global knowledge economy, with opportunities to apply learning modalities and technologies in multicultural contexts. Students may choose from career opportunities such as public education, public health, higher education, educational policy, nonprofit organizations, and curriculum development. Many graduates will pursue advanced degrees leading to teacher credentialing or educational research. Students may also pursue careers in public education supporting students through counseling, school psychology, or student affairs.</p>
				<p>Students who pursue course work in Education Sciences develop richly informed perspectives on the role of education in society. They go on to become leaders in a wide range of fields: discipline-based research in higher education such as linguistics, psychology, sociology, math education, science education, computer science education; general education including teaching, school leadership, and policy; community organization and development; clinical psychology, counseling, English as a second language, special education, social work; medicine; and law.</p>
				<p>Graduates of the Education Sciences major are well positioned to become changemakers within their communities. The skills and knowledge gained through the program will serve them in promoting equitable practices and social equity through access to learning.</p>
				<p>Graduates of the major would be prepared for a career in government agencies, nonprofit organizations, or educational settings as well as graduate studies. The major would be appropriate for students interested in leading discussions about schools and education, informing policy, optimizing e-learning, advocating for accessibility, and supporting the mission of institutions of learning. </p>
				<p>Students in the major have the option of completing a specialization in <em>Elementary Educational Practices</em>; <em>Secondary Educational Practices</em>; and <em>Educational Research and Outreach</em>. With advanced planning, students in the major can complete a minor or second major in another discipline. Students who plan on applying to the graduate program to obtain a California Single Subject Teaching Credential must complete a second major in the content area of their planned teaching credential.</p>
				<p>The BS in Education Sciences is not a professional degree. However, graduates are well prepared to pursue teacher training (see the UC San Diego Teacher Credential program). Students interested in teaching elementary or secondary grades will benefit from completing the major with an emphasis in early childhood learning and development, elementary mathematics education concentration, science education, mathematics education, or learning and development. Students interested in teaching middle or high school are encouraged to meet with a Student Affairs officer to combine the education major with a second major, aiming for proficiency in the subject they plan to teach. All students in the Education Sciences major are required to complete fieldwork hours in an educational setting. </p>
				
				  <h4>The Major </h4>
				  <p>To receive a BS with a major in Education Sciences, students must meet the following requirements: one lower-division course (at least two units) and a total of eleven upper-division courses (at least fifty units), with a minimum of six courses within the Department of Education Studies.</p>
				  <p>The lower-division requirement in Education Sciences is
