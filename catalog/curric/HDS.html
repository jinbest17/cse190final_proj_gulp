<h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">The Human Developmental Sciences  Major </h2>
				<p>The scientific study of human development focuses on issues of growth, development, and behavioral change across the lifespan. The Human Developmental Sciences Program (HDS) is interdisciplinary, incorporating courses from the Departments of Anthropology, Biology, Cognitive Science, Communication, Education Studies, Ethnic Studies, History, Linguistics, Literature, Psychology, Sociology, and Urban Studies and Planning Program. The HDS curriculum is designed to emphasize the idea of development as an essential perspective from which to understand human behavior. The courses cover a broad spectrum of issues in human development: from brain and perceptual development, to reasoning and problem solving, to social interaction and the evolution of cultural systems. HDS unifies and coordinates the excellent research and teaching resources currently available on campus in this area and profiles the factors that influence the ways in which humans develop and change. </p>
				<p>Human development is a very large field, but there is a set of basic questions that serve to define and integrate it: What underlies the development of human knowledge? To what extent is the capacity to know, indeed the concepts themselves, encoded in the genes? How is the role of learning and environmental influences accounted for? How do we learn? What are the ways in which children become competent participants in their social groups? What is the origin and nature of social interaction and organization? </p>
				<p>The study of human development has become increasingly central to a wide range of important issues affecting infants, young children, adolescents, and adults, as well as the changing structure of the American family and public policy on children, health, and education. An understanding of the processes that underlie human development is crucial to our evaluation of these issues and to our ability to offer avenues for remediation of the attendant problems. There are three major areas of study within HDS: biological development, cognitive and language development, and sociocultural development. These areas consider issues that pertain to development of specific neural and cognitive processes and development within a larger social and cultural context. </p>
				<p>Degrees offered for students majoring in human developmental sciences include the following: </p>
				<ul>
                  <li>Human      Developmental Sciences Bachelor of Arts</li>
                  <li>Human      Developmental Sciences Bachelor of Science</li>
                  <li>Human      Developmental Sciences Bachelor of Science with a Specialization in Equity      and Diversity</li>
                  <li>Human      Developmental Sciences Bachelor of Science with a Specialization in      Healthy Aging</li>
                </ul>
                
<h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">Career Guidance </h2>
				<p>A degree in human developmental sciences is designed to impart fundamental skills in critical thinking, comparative analysis, research analysis, and written expression. It offers training of special interest to those considering admission to graduate or professional schools and careers in medicine, law, education, counseling, clinical psychology, public health, public policy, public administration, or social work. The bachelor of arts (BA) provides broad-based preparation for many fields with solid grounding in both theory and methodology in the discipline of human development, while providing a great deal of curricular flexibility. The bachelor of science (BS) requires completion of more rigorous preparatory course work and can be taken within a specialization. It is designed to incorporate additional methods, practicum, apprentice/observation hours, or experiential learning that may be needed for admission to graduate programs or advanced professional training. Students are advised to see an HDS adviser for assistance in selecting a curriculum that best suits their academic and professional objectives. </p>
				<p>A human developmental sciences major can offer preparation for teaching in elementary schools. However, if you are interested in earning a California teaching credential from UC San Diego, contact the Education Studies Minor (EDS) for information about prerequisite and professional preparation requirements. It is recommended you contact EDS as early as possible in your academic career. </p>
<h2>Areas of Specialization</h2>
<p>An HDS major may elect to receive a BS in human developmental sciences with an area of specialization. The areas of specialization are intended to provide majors with guidance in choosing elective courses and to make the specific interests and training of a major clear to prospective employers and graduate schools. Specifying an area of specialization is optional; however, students should take into consideration when planning for their specialization that all approved courses are not necessarily offered every year. </p>
<p>To major in human developmental sciences with an area of specialization, the student must fulfill the requirements for the BS degree and must choose elective course work from a list of approved courses for that area of specialization. The following areas of specialization are currently offered by the program: </p>
<h3>Specialization in Equity and Diversity </h3>
<p>This area of specialization bridges theory and practice to provide more comprehensive scholarship in equity and diversity from a developmental perspective.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Specialization in Healthy Aging </h3>
<p>This area of specialization is intended to equip students with the knowledge to work specifically with the aging population in medicine, research, and industry; with families; and within our communities.  </p>

<h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">Education Abroad </h2>
				<p>Students are often able to participate in the UC Education Abroad Program (EAP) and UC San Diego&rsquo;s Opportunities Abroad Program (OAP) while still making progress toward the major. Students interested in studying abroad should see an HDS adviser to discuss curriculum plans and appropriate courses. It is strongly recommended that students obtain HDS preapproval for study abroad courses that are intended to count toward the major. Information on EAP/OAP is detailed in the <a href="../curric/EAP.html" target="_blank">Education Abroad Program</a> section of the<em> UC San Diego General Catalog</em>. Interested students should contact the Study Abroad UC San Diego office in the International Center and visit the website at <a href="http://studyabroad.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">http://studyabroad.ucsd.edu/</a>. Financial aid is applicable and special study abroad scholarships are available. </p>

                <h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Senior Seminar Requirement HDS 150 </h3>
				<p>Seminar for graduating HDS seniors. Readings and discussion of special topics in human developmental sciences. Provides advanced-level study on subfields of human development. Topics vary quarterly. <strong><em>Prerequisites: </em></strong>HDS 1, HDS 181, HDS 191, senior standing, and department approval one quarter prior to enrollment. </p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Field Research Requirement HDS 191 </h3>
				<p>This course provides students with the opportunity to participate jointly in a research project in conjunction with a mentor/collaborator from a local service site. This applied research experience allows students to design and conduct research projects in a variety of settings ranging from clinical research settings to service oriented placements. In addition to literature research and a final paper at the end of the quarter, students will participate at an off-campus site for a minimum of forty hours during the quarter. Research sites are prearranged one academic year in advance (see the student affairs office or the HDS <a href="http://hdp.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">website</a> for enrollment information). Students&rsquo; interests and future career plans are considered for site placement. Various research orientations and methodologies are reviewed in class. <strong><em>Prerequisites:</em></strong> HDS 1, HDS 181, and department approval one academic year prior to enrollment. </p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Honors in Human Developmental Sciences  HDS 194A-B-C </h3>
				<p>The Human Developmental Sciences Program offers an honors option for those students who have demonstrated excellence in the HDS major. The honors program allows eligible undergraduates to explore advanced issues in the field through an honors thesis on a topic of their choice and under faculty supervision. Eligible students will receive an invitation to participate in the honors program during their junior year. In order to receive an invitation to participate in the honors program, students must have 1) junior standing and 2) maintained a minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.2, and a 3.5 GPA for courses taken in the HDS major. Students with a GPA lower than 3.5 may request to be admitted by exception if they show promise of success in research or creative activity. Students in the honors program are expected to complete the following additional requirements: </p>
<ol>
  <li>HDS      194A-B-C, a yearlong independent research project, which results in an      honors thesis.</li>
  <li>Attendance      in the Human Development Research Seminar (when offered).</li>
  <li>An      advanced course in statistics or methods design (when required by their      honors adviser.)</li>
</ol>


<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Petitioning Courses</h3>
				<p>There are three circumstances under which petitions to receive credit for courses not explicitly approved for the major will be considered (all approved courses are detailed in the <em>UC San Diego General Catalog, </em>HDS section): Requests from transfer students, requests from students planning to study abroad, and exceptional UC San Diego courses identified by a student. In all cases, students are required to submit a petition <strong>in writing</strong> that clearly describes the course for which they wish to receive HDS major credit, and to attach to the petition as much information as possible about the content of the course (e.g., syllabus, course description, etc.). With the exception of courses petitioned by transfer students, ALL REQUESTS FOR APPROVAL OF COURSES NOT EXPLICITLY LISTED IN THE <em>UC SAN DIEGO GENERAL CATALOG</em> SHOULD BE SUBMITTED BEFORE THE COURSE IS TAKEN BY THE STUDENT. </p>
<h5>Transfer Courses</h5>
				<p>Students transferring from a community college or other university must petition for HDS credit for courses taken at their previous institution. For students transferring from the California Community College System, articulation agreements for many courses have been developed that facilitate the petition process. Please see <a href="http://www.assist.org" target="_blank">www.assist.org</a> for more information. Transfer students should make an appointment with an HDS adviser to review courses for which they will most likely receive credit and fill out a written petition for each course. </p>
<h5>Study Abroad Courses</h5>
				<p>Students planning to study abroad may receive credit toward the major for courses taken in another country. IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED THAT STUDENTS RECEIVE PRELIMINARY APPROVAL (BEFORE LEAVING THE COUNTRY) FOR COURSES THEY ARE CONSIDERING TAKING DURING THEIR TIME ABROAD. While the preliminary approval does not guarantee that the actual course will be approved, the great majority of courses for which preliminary approval has been obtained are approved when the actual petition is submitted upon the student&rsquo;s return. </p>
<h5><span class="myriad-pro-italic">UC San Diego Courses</span></h5>
				<p>Occasionally, students identify a new UC San Diego course that has the potential to fulfill an HDS requirement. Students may petition<strong> in writing </strong>to request credit for such courses. However, it is important to note that very few such petitions are successful, and students are strongly cautioned to petition and receive approval for such a course BEFORE ENROLLING IN THE COURSE. </p>
				<p><strong>Note: </strong>Courses are not officially approved for credit until the written petition has been approved by the HDS Executive Committee and signed by the HDS director.</p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2"><a name="minor" id="minor"></a>The HDS Minor </h3>
