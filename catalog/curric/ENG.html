<p><em>All courses, faculty listings, and curricular and degree requirements described herein are subject to change or deletion without notice. </em></p>
<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p>The Irwin and Joan Jacobs School of Engineering at UC San Diego comprises the Departments of Bioengineering (BE), Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE), NanoEngineering (NE), and Structural Engineering (SE). The Jacobs School is directed by the dean of Engineering. The departments offer seventeen undergraduate programs as well as many graduate degree programs. For links to engineering undergraduate and graduate programs, please visit <a href="http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/academic/" target="_blank">http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/academic/</a>. Students interested in engineering should consult the website and the individual department listings that follow this section of the catalog. </p>
<p>UC San Diego&#8217;s six undergraduate colleges differ in their general-education requirements. Prospective students should review the general-education requirements and take them into account when planning their college curriculum. </p>
		<h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1"><span class="anchor-parent"><a name="acceptance" id="acceptance" class="anchor"></a>Acceptance to Departmental Majors in the Jacobs School of Engineering </span></h2>
				<p>Student demand exceeds program capacity in all of the undergraduate majors. Owing to limited departmental resources, engineering major programs have more students apply than can be accepted, and have been declared capped majors. Acceptance into a capped engineering major is based on academic excellence demonstrated in high school or at a community college. Acceptance will be granted to the maximum number of students in each of these capped major programs consistent with maintaining acceptable program quality and in compliance with admissions procedures and criteria approved by the Academic Senate&rsquo;s Educational Policy Committee. </p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Freshmen		</h3>
<p>All engineering majors are capped. Freshman applicants must indicate an engineering major as their first choice on their UC application in order to be considered for acceptance to the major by the UC San Diego Office of Admissions. </p>
<p>It is strongly suggested that all students accepted into engineering programs consult their department&#8217;s academic adviser at an early stage to plan their lower-division engineering courses, and that they consult with a college academic counselor to arrange general-education courses around the required screening courses. Students admitted fall quarter should attend the engineering department&#8217;s orientation meetings during Welcome Week.</p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Transfers</h3>
				<p>Following California&#8217;s Master Plan for Higher Education, UC San Diego gives high priority to students transferring from California community colleges. </p>
				<p>All engineering majors are capped for transfer admissions. Since acceptance to capped engineering majors is quite competitive for freshman and transfer applicants alike, academic standards are high. Acceptance to capped majors may be limited to the best transfer applicants, e.g., those who have been admitted to UC San Diego with the most complete lower-division preparation and the highest college grade point averages. Since acceptance is restricted to these majors, <strong>transfer students are encouraged to apply to more than one major degree program and to include one open major in their selection. </strong></p>
				<p>Transfer students who choose capped engineering major programs as their first-choice major on their UC application are required to complete the minimum lower-division major preparation courses prior to transferring. Many of the following courses are<strong> required to be taken for a letter grade</strong> for all engineering transfer students in their major: </p>
<ul>
		<li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Linear Algebra (MATH 18)</li>
<li class="list-level-1">Calculus I—for Science and Engineering (MATH 20A)</li>
		<li class="list-level-1">Calculus II—for Science and Engineering (MATH 20B)</li>
		<li class="list-level-1">Calculus and Analytic Geometry (MATH 20C)</li>
		<li class="list-level-1">Differential Equations (MATH 20D)</li>
		<li class="list-level-1">Complete calculus-based physics series with lab experience (PHYS 2A-B-C)</li>
		<li class="list-level-1">CHEM 6A (except computer science and computer engineering majors)<br /><strong class="italic">Note: </strong>A total of ten quarter-units of general chemistry (including laboratory) will be recommended for students applying to all majors offered by the Department of Bioengineering. </li>
		<li class="list-level-1">Highest level of introductory computer programming
		  language course offerings at the community college<a href="#ast">*</a></li>
	  </ul>
				<p><a name="ast" id="ast"></a>*Refer to the<em> UC San Diego General Catalog</em> to
				  select major prerequisite recommendations for computer language courses. </p>
				<p><strong>Please note that exact transfer admission requirements may vary by major and department. For exact eligibility criteria, please reference the respective department&rsquo;s&nbsp;catalog&nbsp;listing or the California community college articulation agreement listed on <a href="https://assist.org/" target="_blank">https://assist.org</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Continuing UC San Diego Students </h3>
				<p>Effective fall 2015, all engineering majors are capped for continuing UC San Diego undergraduate students. Continuing UC San Diego undergraduate students who wish to change into capped engineering majors must submit an application to the department on or before the target dates and must meet minimum requirements. Interested students should visit this website for additional information: <a href="http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/academic/academic_undergrad/my_major.shtml" target="_blank">http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/academic/academic_undergrad/my_major.shtml</a></p>
<h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">Double Majors and Minors </h2>
				<p>It is the policy of the UC San Diego Academic Senate not to approve double majors within engineering. Students who qualify for admission to graduate school and who have the extra time are encouraged to consider integrated five-year bachelor&rsquo;s/master&rsquo;s programs. </p>
<p>For more information visit <a href="http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/academic/academic_undergrad/bs-ms.sfe" target="_blank">http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/academic/academic_undergrad/bs-ms.sfe</a>.		</p>
