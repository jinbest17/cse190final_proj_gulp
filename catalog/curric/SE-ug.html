<!-- #EndLibraryItem --><p class="basic-offset-top-only"><strong class="myriad-pro-semibold">Structural engineering</strong> is the branch of engineering concerned with the design and analysis of civil, mechanical, aerospace, marine, naval and offshore structures. It requires knowledge and competence in the areas of materials, response of individual structural components, and the behavior of entire structural systems. </p>
				<h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">Department Focus </h2>
				<p>The instructional and research programs of the department are grouped into four programmatic focus areas: civil structures, aerospace and composite structures, SHM/NDE (structural health monitoring/nondestructive evaluation), and geotechnical engineering. Both the undergraduate and graduate programs are characterized by strong interdisciplinary relationships with the Departments of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Physics, Mathematics, Bioengineering, Chemistry, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science and Engineering, the Materials Science Program, and associated campus institutes such as the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics, Institute for Pure and Applied Physical Sciences, Institute for Biomedical Engineering, Center of Excellence for Advanced Materials, California Space Institute, Calit2&rsquo;s Qualcomm Institute, and Scripps Institution of Oceanography. </p>
				<p>The program and curricula of the Department of Structural Engineering will educate and train engineers in a holistic approach to structural systems engineering by emphasizing and building on the commonality of engineering structures in materials, mechanics, analysis and design across the engineering disciplines of civil, aerospace, marine, and mechanical engineering. </p>
				<p>Although structural engineering is traditionally viewed as an activity within civil engineering, in actuality many other engineering disciplines such as aerospace, marine (naval, offshore), and mechanical engineering contain well established discipline-specific structural systems and components. In all of the various engineering disciplines there exists a large commonality in the structural materials used, in the general principles of structural mechanics, in the overall design philosophy and criteria, and in the modeling and analysis tools employed for the numerical quantification and visualization of structural response. Particularly, small disciplinary differences in materials and computational tools are rapidly disappearing with the civil engineering community opening up to new structural materials developed and used to date primarily in the aerospace industry, and with computational developments which are less product specific but more geared toward a holistic structural systems design approach with interactive graphics, object-oriented database management and concurrent visualization and data processing. Developments in overall structural systems design are increasingly cross-disciplinary over many traditional engineering areas. </p>
				<p class="anchor-parent"><a class="anchor" id="ugrad"></a></p><h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">The Undergraduate Program </h2>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Degree and Program Options </h3>
				<p>The Department of Structural Engineering offers a unique engineering program leading to the bachelor&rsquo;s of science in structural engineering. The BS in structural engineering program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, <a href="http://www.abet.org" target="_blank"> http://www.abet.org</a>. The BS programs require a minimum of 145 units, plus college general-education requirements in humanities and social sciences. </p>
<p>The structural engineering program of study has strong components in laboratory experimentation, numerical computation, and engineering design. Design is emphasized throughout the curricula by open-ended homework problems, by laboratory and computer courses that include student-initiated projects, and finally, by senior design project courses that involve teams of students working to solve engineering design problems brought in from industry. The structural engineering program is designed to prepare students receiving a bachelor&rsquo;s degree for professional careers or for graduate education in their area of specialization. In addition, the program can also be taken by students who intend to use their undergraduate engineering education as preparation for postgraduate professional training in nontechnical fields such as business administration, law, or medicine. </p>
<p><strong class="myriad-pro-semibold">Structural engineering </strong>is concerned with the design and analysis of civil, mechanical, aerospace, marine, naval, and offshore structures. Examples include bridges, dams, buildings, aircraft, spacecraft, ships, oil platforms, automobiles, and other transportation vehicles. This field requires a thorough knowledge of the behavior of solids (concrete, soils, rock, metals, plastics, and composite materials), fluid mechanics as it relates to structural loads, dynamics as it relates to structural response, mathematics for the generation of theoretical structural models and numerical analysis, and computer science for simulation purposes associated with computer-aided design, response analyses, and data acquisition. Basic understanding of materials behavior and structural performance is enhanced by laboratory courses involving static and dynamic stress failure tests of structural models, and response of structural systems. Within this area, students can specialize in (a) civil structures, (b) aerospace structures, (c) SHM/NDE,  or (d) geotechnical engineering. </p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Major Requirements </h3>
				<p>Specific course requirements for the major are outlined in a table herein. In addition to the required technical courses specifically indicated, a suggested scheduling of general-education courses (GE) are distributed in the curricula for students to use to meet college general-education requirements. To graduate, students must maintain an overall GPA of at least 2.0, and the department requires at least a C– grade in each course required for the major. <strong>All courses required for the major must be taken for a letter grade.</strong> This includes all lower-division math and science courses as well as the technical electives (TE).</p>
				<p>Deviations from the program of study must be approved by the Undergraduate Affairs Committee prior to taking alternative courses. In cases where a student needs to take a course outside UC San Diego, prior departmental approval is essential. TE courses are restricted to meet ABET standards. In addition, technical elective course selections must have departmental approval prior to taking the courses. Courses such as SE 195, SE 197 and SE 198 are not allowed as technical electives in meeting the upper-division major requirements. SE 199 can be used as a technical elective only under restrictive conditions. Policies regarding these conditions may be obtained from the department&rsquo;s undergraduate advising office. Students with different academic preparations may vary the scheduling of lower-division courses such as math, physics and chemistry, but should consult the department prior to doing so. Deviations in scheduling lower-division structural engineering courses are discouraged due to scheduling constraints. A tentative schedule of course offerings is available from the department each spring quarter for the following academic year. </p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">General Education/College Requirement </h3>
				<p>For graduation, each student must satisfy general-education course requirements determined by the student&#8217;s college, as well as the major requirements determined by the department. The six colleges at UC San Diego require widely different general-education courses, and the number of such courses differs from one college to another. Each student should choose his or her college carefully, considering the special nature of the college and the breadth of general education. </p>
				<p>The structural engineering program allows for thirteen general-education (GE) courses so that students can fulfill their college requirements. Students must develop a program that includes a total of at least twenty-four units in the arts, humanities, and social sciences, not including subjects such as accounting, industrial management, finance, or personnel administration. It should be noted, however, that some colleges may require more than, or less than, the thirteen GE courses indicated in the curriculum table. Students in colleges that require more than thirteen GE courses may take longer to graduate than the indicated four-year schedule. Students must consult with their college to determine which GE courses to take. </p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Professional Licensing </h3>
				<p>All students are encouraged to take the Engineering-in-Training (EIT) examination as the first step in becoming licensed as a professional engineer (PE). Students graduating from an accredited program can take the PE examination after EIT certification and two years of work experience. </p>
<p>For further information please contact your local Board of Registration for Professional Engineers, Land Surveyors, and Geologists or visit <a href="http://bpelsg.ca.gov/" target="_blank">http://bpelsg.ca.gov/</a>.		</p>

<h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">Policies and Procedures for Structural Engineering Undergraduate Students </h2>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Admission to the Major </h3>
		<p>Due to the large number of students interested in the structural engineering undergraduate program, and the limited resources available to accommodate this demand, the university has declared the structural engineering major as capped.</p>
        <div>
          <div> </div>
        </div>
<p>Effective fall 2015, admission will be limited to the major (BS structural engineering) for all incoming freshmen and transfers, as well as all continuing UC San Diego students.</p>
<p>New freshmen will be selected according to the UC San Diego Office of Undergraduate Admissions Holistic Review scores, taking into consideration the number of slots available in the Department of Structural Engineering. Students who meet the UC San Diego admission criteria will be admitted into their chosen capped major, starting with the student having the highest holistic review score, until the admission target number is reached. Students will be notified directly by the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools whether they have been admitted into their chosen capped major. All potential freshmen must indicate on the UC application if they wish to major in structural engineering. </p>
				<p>Freshman students who applied but were not admitted directly from high school into the capped <em>structural engineering</em> major will be admitted into the major indicated as their second choice on the UC application (providing it is an &ldquo;open&rdquo; major). </p>
<p>New transfer students will be selected by the UC San Diego Office of Undergraduate Admissions based on the students&rsquo; community college GPA and taking into consideration the number of slots available in the Department of Structural Engineering. Additionally, transfer students should have completed courses equivalent to UC San Diego&rsquo;s MATH 18, MATH 20A-D; PHYS 2A-C, 2BL, 2CL; and CHEM 6A. Students who meet the UC San Diego admission criteria will be admitted into their chosen capped major, starting with the student having the highest community college GPA, until the admission target number is reached. Transfer students who have excelled in their community college courses, especially courses in math, physics, and chemistry, will have the strongest advantage. These students will be notified directly by the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools whether they have been admitted into their chosen capped major. All potential transfer students must indicate on the UC application if they wish to major in structural engineering.</p>
<p>Transfer students who applied but were not admitted directly from community college into the capped <em>structural engineering</em> major will be admitted into the major indicated as their second choice on the UC application (providing it is an &ldquo;open&rdquo; major). </p>
                <h3>Continuing Students</h3>
                <p>Applications will be accepted once per quarter for admission (change of major) into the capped <em>structural engineering </em>major. For detailed information please see the &ldquo;Admission&rdquo; section of the Department of Structural Engineering website at <a href="http://structures.ucsd.edu/index.php/academics/undergraduate-program/undergraduate-admission" target="_blank">http://structures.ucsd.edu/index.php/academics/undergraduate-program/undergraduate-admission</a>. </p>
<p>Continuing students are not eligible to apply after six quarters (two years) for freshmen, and after three quarters (one year) for transfers, as time to graduation would be delayed. The majority of departmental upper-division courses are currently offered only once a year. In addition, continuing students who wish to be considered must meet the following minimum requirements:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>completed      at least two quarters in residence at UC San Diego.</li>
  <li>completed      the lower-division requirements for the requested major (see <a href="http://se.ucsd.edu/index.php/academics/undergraduate-resources" target="_blank">SE website</a> for specific screening courses).</li>
</ol>

                <p>Applications will be ranked according to the highest UC San Diego GPA in the required courses and applications will be approved until the predetermined target enrollment number is reached. </p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Transfer Students </h3>
				<p>Requirements for a structural engineering major, or into structural engineering courses, are the same for transfer students as they are for continuing students. Accordingly, when planning their program, transfer students should be mindful of lower-division prerequisite course requirements, as well as for meeting collegiate requirements. </p>
				<p>Students who have taken equivalent courses elsewhere may request to have transfer credits apply toward the department&#8217;s major requirements. This is accomplished by submitting a petition for transfer credits together with a transcript and course syllabus  from the institution where the course(s) were taken. These documents are reviewed for approval by the Structural Engineering Undergraduate Affairs Committee. </p>
				<p> SE 1, SE 3, and SE 9 must be taken by all students majoring in structural engineering. </p>
				<p>Undergraduate student petition forms are available online on <a href="http://tritonlink.ucsd.edu" target="_blank">TritonLink</a>. </p>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Academic Advising </h3>
				<p>Upon arrival, students must make an appointment with the structural engineering undergraduate advising office to plan a program of study. The program plan may be revised in subsequent years, but revisions involving curricular requirements require approval by an undergraduate adviser or the Undergraduate Affairs Committee. Because some courses and/or curricular changes may be made every year, it is imperative that students consult with the department&rsquo;s undergraduate advising office and their assigned faculty adviser on an annual basis. </p>
<p><strong class="myriad-pro-semibold">Many structural engineering courses are offered only once a year and therefore should be taken in the recommended sequence. If courses are taken out of sequence, it may not always be possible to enroll in subsequent courses as desired or needed. </strong>If this occurs, students should seek immediate department advice. When a student deviates from the sequence of courses specified for the curriculum in this catalog, it may be impossible to complete the structural engineering major within the normal four-year period. Students should refer to the four-year plan and course prerequisite map on the department website at <a href="http://structures.ucsd.edu" target="_blank">http://structures.ucsd.edu</a>. </p>
				<p>In addition to the advising available through the structural engineering undergraduate advising office, programmatic or technical advice may be obtained from structural engineering faculty members. A specific structural engineering faculty adviser is assigned to each structural engineering student. All structural engineering students are required to meet with their faculty adviser at least once a year, preferably before the beginning of fall quarter. </p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Program Alterations/Exceptions to Requirements </h3>
				<p>Variations from, or exceptions to, any program or course requirements are possible only if a petition is approved by the structural engineering Undergraduate Affairs Committee before the courses in question are taken. Petition forms may be obtained online on <a href="http://tritonlink.ucsd.edu" target="_blank">TritonLink</a> and must be processed through the structural engineering undergraduate advising office. </p>

<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Independent Study </h3>
				<p>Structural engineering students may take SE 199, Independent Study for
				  Undergraduates, under the guidance of a structural engineering
				  faculty member. Normally, this course is taken as an elective
				  on a P/NP basis. Under restrictive conditions, however, it
				  may be used to satisfy upper-division technical elective course requirements
				  for the major. Students interested in taking an SE 199 course
				  must identify a faculty member with whom they wish to work and propose
				  a research or study topic. After obtaining the faculty member’s concurrence
				  on the topic and scope of the study, the student must submit
