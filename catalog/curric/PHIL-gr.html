<p>The department offers programs leading to the MA and PhD. It is the intention
  of the graduate program to enable the student to obtain an understanding of
  diverse traditions and to develop as a philosopher in his or her own right.
  To this end, the department offers courses and seminars in the history of philosophy
  and in traditional and contemporary philosophical issues, from a variety of
  perspectives.</p>
<h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">Doctoral Degree Program </h2>
		<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Course Work </h3>
				<p>Over the first two years, students will normally take at least three courses
				  per quarter, of which at least two are philosophy seminars (numbered 200–285).
				  The balance may be made up from additional graduate courses in philosophy,
				  up to two independent studies in philosophy, upper-division courses in
				  philosophy (those numbered 100–199), approved upper-division or graduate courses in related departments, and, if the student is a teaching assistant, PHIL 500 (Apprentice Teaching). In any case, before advancing to candidacy, students must have completed fourteen graduate seminars, twelve of which are graduate philosophy seminars. These philosophy seminars must each be completed with a grade of B+ or better.</p>
				<div>
				  <div> </div>
	    </div>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Proseminar </h3>
				<p>In fall quarter of their first year of residence, graduate students will
				  take a proseminar designed to introduce them to philosophical methods and
				  improve their skills at writing and analysis. Enrollment in the proseminar
				  is limited to first-year students. The proseminar may be team-taught. The
				  topics to be covered will address some central area or areas of philosophy
				  and will vary from year to year. The proseminar is a regular four-unit
			    seminar.</p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Core Courses </h3>
				<p>In the following areas, the department shall offer “core” or advanced introductory
				  seminars: philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, philosophy of science,
				  the history of philosophy, epistemology, metaphysics, ethics and political
				  philosophy. The department shall offer at least three of these courses
				  in each academic year. Students must take two of these core courses by
				  the end of their second year of residence. Courses taken to satisfy this
			    requirement may be applied toward the distribution requirement.                </p>
				<p>Core courses are not necessarily distinguished by the numbers
                  under which they are offered, but by their content. A core
                  course provides a point of entry into a field that is suitable
                  for graduate students with no prior work in this area of philosophy
                  as well as students with some background knowledge. A core
                  course may be a general survey of a field, or alternatively
                  may take up some central, relatively nonspecialized topic.
                  (Though core courses are intended to provide students with
                  an entry point into particular philosophical topics, students
                  are welcome to supplement the graduate core courses with upper-division
                  undergraduate philosophy courses—those numbered 100–199—which are often organized as surveys.) A core course may offer
                  students the option of writing shorter papers rather than one
                  long seminar paper; in some cases, a final examination may be
                  offered. The decision whether to count a course as core will
                  be made by the instructor in consultation with the graduate
                  adviser.</p>
		<p class="anchor-parent"><a class="anchor" id="distribution"></a></p><h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Distribution Requirements </h3>
				<p>Before advancing to candidacy students must have completed, with a grade of B+ or better, nine graduate
				  seminars in philosophy (in addition to the proseminar) distributed
				  across the subfields of philosophy listed below. Students must
				  take three seminars in the history of philosophy (including
				  one in ancient philosophy and one in modern philosophy), two
				  seminars in two other areas, and at least one seminar in every area: </p>
		<div>
				  <div> </div>
	    </div>
<ol>
	  <li>History of Philosophy </li>
	  <li>Philosophy of Science      
	  <li>Philosophy of Mind and Philosophy of Language      
	  <li>Ethics and Political
      Philosophy      
	  <li>Metaphysics and Epistemology
      </ol>
		<p>Courses used to satisfy a requirement in one category cannot be used to
		  satisfy a requirement in another category. The determination as to what category
		  or categories a particular seminar taught in a given quarter may count toward
		  is normally made by the seminar instructor.        </p>
		<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Logic Requirement </h3>
		<p>In their first year of residence, all graduate students must demonstrate
          proficiency in basic formal logic (the predicate calculus, up to and
          including functions, relations, and identity) either by passing an
          examination in this material (normally offered each fall and often
          in spring) or by taking PHIL 120 (Symbolic Logic) during their
          first year of study and achieving a grade of B+ or better. By the end
          of their second year of residence, all students must pass an advanced
          logic course (PHIL122, 123, 126, 222, or another logic class
          approved by the graduate adviser) with a grade of B+ or better.        </p>
		<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Third-Year Qualifying Paper  Requirement </h3>
		<p>By the end of the spring quarter of their third year in the program, each student must submit for approval a substantial research essay of about 7,500–9,000 words to their third-year committee. The third-year committee will assess the merits of the essay and determine whether it meets the required standards of quality and sophistication. Approved essays will demonstrate that, in the eyes of the committee, the student has acquired the skills necessary to produce a substantial, original, valuable, and polished piece of philosophical scholarship. It is intended that the student will complete this requirement during their third year of residence in close consultation with all members of the third-year committee. (A formal petition must be made for any extension beyond the third year.) The student must satisfy this requirement before advancing to candidacy. </p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Research Skills Requirement </h3>
		<p>Before advancing to candidacy, students will normally be required
          to demonstrate competence in a skill outside philosophy but relevant
          to his or her dissertation research.        </p>
		<p>Which skill is appropriate will be decided by the student in consultation
          with his or her first- or second-year advisers and the graduate adviser.
          Examples of ways in which students may satisfy the skills requirement
          include demonstrating competence in a foreign language relevant to
          their research (e.g., Classical Greek, Latin, French, or German, for
          students working in the history of philosophy); passing three upper-division
          undergraduate or graduate-level courses in biology, physics, mathematics,
          or linguistics (for students working in the philosophy of biology,
          physics, mathematics, or language); passing three upper-division undergraduate
          or graduate-level courses in political science, economics or sociology
          (for students working in political philosophy or ethics). </p>
		<p>Specific decisions about the satisfaction of this requirement will
          be made on a case-by-case basis by the graduate adviser and the student’s
          advisers and will be made on grounds of the intellectual relevance
          of the proposed research skill and the needs of the student.</p>
        <div>
          <div> </div>
          <div> </div>
        </div>
        <h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Independent Study Courses </h3>
				<p><span class="course-list-overview">PHIL 290 (Directed
				    Independent Study)</span> is appropriate for a graduate student still in the process
				  of fulfilling course requirements for the degree. However,
				  this course will not normally be approved for students in the first year
				  of the program and will not normally count toward the satisfaction of
				  distribution requirements. </p>
<p><span class="course-list-overview">PHIL 295 (Research Topics)</span> is an appropriate course for a student in the process of working toward a
  dissertation prospectus. </p>
				<p><span class="course-list-overview">PHIL 299 (Thesis Research)</span> is appropriate for a student working on his or her dissertation. </p>
        <h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Teaching Requirements </h3>
                <p>Participation in undergraduate teaching is one of the requirements for a PhD in philosophy. Students are required to serve as a teaching assistant for (at a minimum) the equivalent of one-quarter time (ten hours per week) for three academic quarters. The duties of a teaching assistant normally entail grading papers and examinations, conducting discussion sections, and related activities, including attendance at lectures in the course for which he or she is assisting. </p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Dissertation Prospectus and Oral Candidacy Exam</h3>
				<p>Sometime after completing the distribution requirements, the student must
				  submit a dissertation prospectus to his or her doctoral committee. The
				  committee will then orally examine the student on the intended subject
				  and plan of research. The examination will seek to establish that the thesis
				  proposed is a satisfactory subject of research and that the student has
				  the preparation and the abilities necessary to complete that research.
				  This oral qualifying exam must be passed before the end of the fourth year
				  of study (twelfth quarter of residence). Students who are passed and have
			    met the other requirements will be advanced to candidacy for the PhD.</p>
		<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Doctoral Dissertation </h3>
				<p>Under the supervision of a doctoral committee, each candidate will write
				  a dissertation demonstrating a capacity to engage in original and independent
				  research. The candidate will defend the thesis in an oral examination by
			    the doctoral committee. </p>
        <h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Academic Advising </h3>
        <h4>First- and Second-Year Academic Advising </h4>
        <p>After consultation with the graduate adviser, each entering
                  student will be assigned a faculty adviser. Students are encouraged
                  to meet with their faculty advisers once a quarter during their
                  first two years to plan their course of study and review their
                  progress in the program. Students may change their faculty
                  adviser after one has been assigned. Advising duties will shift
                  to the third-year committee in the student’s third year of
                  study, and then to the dissertation committee once the student
                  begins the dissertation.                </p>
        <h4>Third-Year Academic Advising </h4>
        <p>At the end of the student’s second year of study, the department
                  will appoint a three-member faculty committee for that student.
                  The composition of the committee will reflect the student’s
                  preferences and the area of philosophy in which the student
                  is inclined to do dissertation work. One of the members of
                  the committee will be designated as the committee chair and
                  will serve as the student’s main adviser. The committee will
                  meet, at a minimum, once in the spring of the student’s second
                  year of study, once in the fall of the student’s third year,
                  and once in the spring of the student’s third year. The responsibilities
                  of the committee include advising the student in developing
                  a sound dissertation project, the acquisition of professional
                  skills (possibly through the departmental professional skills
                  workshop), and advancing to candidacy in a timely manner. The
                  members of this third-year committee may but need not be members
                  of the student’s dissertation committee.                </p>
        <h4>Professional Skills Workshop </h4>
        <p>The department will offer each year a noncredit workshop on
                  professional skills. Topics covered may include publication
                  strategies, the mechanics of the job market, and how to write
                  a cv. This workshop is open to any student in the department,
                  and all students are encouraged to attend at least once before
                  going on the job market.                </p>
        <h4>Academic Advising after Candidacy </h4>
        <p>After advancing to candidacy, the student will select a dissertation
                  committee that will advise him or her throughout the writing
                  of the dissertation, supply feedback on the material of the
                  dissertation, and conduct the oral dissertation defense. The
                  standard committee consists of five faculty members. Three
                  of these faculty members will be from the Department of Philosophy,
                  and one of these (who must be tenured) will be designated as
                  the principal director of the student’s dissertation. In addition
                  to the three philosophy faculty, the dissertation committee
                  must include at least two faculty from outside the Department
                  of Philosophy, at least one of whom must be a tenured UC San
          Diego faculty member.                </p>
        <h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">PhD in Philosophy with a Specialization in Interdisciplinary Environmental Research </h3>
        <p>A graduate specialization in Interdisciplinary Environmental Research (PIER) is available for select doctoral students in philosophy. PIER students seek solutions to today’s environmental challenges. <strong> </strong></p>
        <p>The PhD specialization is designed to allow students to obtain standard training in their chosen field and an opportunity to interact with peers in different disciplines throughout the duration of their doctoral projects. Such communication across disciplines is key to fostering a capacity for interdisciplinary &ldquo;language&rdquo; skills and conceptual flexibility.</p>
        <h4>Specialization Requirements<br>
        </h4>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>Complete      all course work, dissertation, and other requirements of the philosophy PhD<strong>  </strong></li>

        </div>
        <h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Master’s Degree </h3>
        <p>The UC San Diego Department of Philosophy does not admit students
                  with the intention of completing their studies at the master’s
                  level. Nonetheless, PhD students in the department sometimes
                  elect to receive the master’s degree in the course of their
                  academic progress.                </p>
        <p>To qualify for a master’s degree in philosophy, a student
                  must pass eight of the distribution requirement seminars as
                  described above, under the subheading “<a href="#distribution">Distribution
                  Requirements</a>.”
          No more than four seminars from any one of the five areas may
                  count toward the master’s degree. The student must also complete
                  a master’s research paper under the direction of a faculty
                  member of his or her choice, and have it approved by two members
                  of the department faculty.</p>
<p class="anchor-parent"><a class="anchor" id="interdisc"></a></p><h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">Interdisciplinary Degree Programs</h2>
				<p>The philosophy department at UC San Diego participates in three interdisciplinary
				  programs, the requirements for which are outlined below. </p>
				<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Interdisciplinary Degree Program in Cognitive Science </h3>
				<p>The Interdisciplinary PhD Program in Cognitive Science includes faculty
				  from a number of UC San Diego departments including the Departments
				  of Anthropology, Biology and Neurobiology, Cognitive Science,
				  Communication, Computer Science and Engineering, Linguistics, Music, Neurosciences,
				  Philosophy, Psychiatry, Psychology, and Sociology. This group includes
				  many outstanding figures in contemporary cognitive science.                </p>
				<p>Students wishing to pursue a PhD in philosophy and cognitive
                  science register in the philosophy program in the normal fashion
                  but pursue a significant portion of their studies with faculty
                  in the several departments participating in the interdisciplinary
                  program. Students may apply for admission to the interdisciplinary
                  program at the same time that they apply to the Department
                  of Philosophy, or at some point after entering UC San Diego. (All students
                  wishing to transfer into any interdisciplinary program must
        do so prior to the end of the fifth quarter of residency.)</p>
				<p> Students in philosophy/cognitive science are required to complete all
				  of the requirements for the PhD in philosophy with the following
				  five amendments: </p>
				<ol>
				  <li>The student must take six quarters of COGS 200.</li>
				  <li>The student must take the equivalent of one year’s course work (usually
				    six courses) in one or more of the other departments affiliated with
				    the Department of Cognitive Science. (It should be noted that a philosophy
				    graduate student who completes this requirement is deemed thereby to
				    have satisfied the philosophy special skills requirement by gaining an
				    approved special competency.)</li>
				  <li>The distribution requirement is amended as follows: Before advancing
				    to candidacy a philosophy/cognitive science student must
				    have completed nine graduate seminars in philosophy distributed
				    across the areas of (A) philosophy of science, (B) philosophy
				    of mind and philosophy of language, (C) ethics and political
				    philosophy, (D) epistemology and metaphysics, and (E) history
				    of philosophy. The student must take at least one seminar from each of
				    these five areas and at least two seminars from any four of these areas.</li>
				  <li>The course work requirement is amended as follows: Over the first two
				    years, a philosophy/cognitive science student will normally take at least three
				    courses/seminars per quarter. Besides graduate seminars in philosophy
				    and cognitive science, these may include up to two independent studies
				    in philosophy, upper-division courses in philosophy (those numbered 100–199),
				    approved upper-division or graduate courses in cognitive science and
				    affiliated departments, and, if the student is a teaching assistant,
				    PHIL 500 (Apprentice Teaching). (It should be noted that philosophy/cognitive
				    students who complete all the other requirements for cognitive studies
				    and who complete the amended distribution requirement above are thereby
				    deemed to have completed the fourteen graduate seminars required of students
			      prior to their advancing to candidacy.)</li>
				  <li>A plan detailing the course of study must be approved by the Cognitive
				    Science Program Committee. The dissertation should be interdisciplinary,
				    reflecting the two areas of specialization.

		<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Interdisciplinary Program in Science Studies</h3>
				<p>The Science Studies Program at UC San Diego is committed to interdisciplinary
				  investigations. Understanding, interpreting, and explaining the scientific
				  enterprise demands a systematic integration of the perspectives developed
				  within the communication of science, history of science, sociology of science,
				  and philosophy of science. The program offers students an opportunity to
				  work toward such integration, while receiving a thorough training at the
				  professional level in one of the component disciplines (communications,
			    history, sociology, philosophy).                </p>
				<p>Students enrolled in the program choose one of the component
                  disciplines for their major field of specialist studies (for
                  students enrolled in the Department of Philosophy, this major
                  field is, of course, philosophy), and are required to complete
				  minor field requirements in the others. The core of the program,
				  however, is a yearlong seminar in science studies, led by
				  faculty from all participating departments.</p>
<p>Students may apply for admission to the interdisciplinary
                  program at the same time that they apply to the Department
                  of Philosophy, or at some point after entering UC San Diego. (All students
                  wishing to transfer into any interdisciplinary program must
        do so prior to the end of the fifth quarter of residency.)</p>
<p>Students in philosophy/science studies are required to complete all of the
  requirements for the PhD in philosophy with the following seven amendments:</p>
<ol>
	  <li>The student must attend the Science Studies Colloquium series for his
	    or her entire first and second years. He or she will receive course credit
	    (PHIL 209C) in any two quarters of his or her choice (once in the first
	    year and once in the second year, with exceptions to be considered by the
	    director of science studies). This course is taken for an S/U grade option
	    only.</li>
      <li>Before defending his or her prospectus, the student must take Introduction
        to Science Studies I (PHIL 209A), Introduction to Science Studies II (PHIL 209D),
        and two iterations (with changed content) of the Core Seminar in Science
        Studies (PHIL 209B). (These courses are required in addition to the proseminar
        in philosophy, which is required of all PhD students in philosophy.)</li>
<li>The student must, prior to defending his or her prospectus, take two additional
  science studies courses outside philosophy drawn from a list of approved courses
  available each year from the Science Studies Program office. (One course in
  one of the sciences may be substituted for one of these courses as part of
  an approved program of study.)</li>
<li>The distribution requirement is amended as follows: Before advancing to candidacy,
  a philosophy/science studies student must have completed nine seminars in philosophy distributed
  across the areas of (A) philosophy of science, (B) philosophy of mind and philosophy
  of language, (C) ethics and political philosophy, (D) metaphysics and epistemology,
  and (E) history of philosophy. Students must take at least one seminar from
  each of these five areas and at least two seminars from any four of these areas.</li>
<li>The course work requirement is amended as follows: Over the first two years,
  a philosophy/science studies student will normally take at least three courses/seminars
  per quarter. Besides graduate seminars in philosophy and science studies, these
  may include up to two independent studies in philosophy, upper-division courses
  in philosophy (those numbered 100–199), approved upper-division or graduate
  courses in science studies and affiliated departments, and, if the student
  is a teaching assistant, PHIL 500 (Apprentice Teaching). (It should be
  noted that philosophy/science studies students who complete all the other requirements
  for science studies and who complete the amended distribution requirements
  for philosophy are thereby deemed to have completed the fourteen graduate seminars
  required of students prior to their advancing to candidacy.)</li>
<li>The student’s program of study must be approved by the Department of Philosophy
  faculty adviser for science studies.</li>
<li>At least two internal members and at least one external member of the student’s
  dissertation committee should be faculty of the Science Studies Program. Exceptions
  to this policy require permission from the director of the Science Studies
  Program.</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Dual Degree Program with University of San Diego Law School </h3>
<p>Students pursuing the PhD in philosophy at UC San Diego can also pursue a degree
  at the University of San Diego (USD) School of Law, either the JD (normally
  a three-year degree) or the MSLS (a one-year master’s degree). Students
  must be admitted independently to the two programs and must complete the requirements
  for both programs. Once admitted to both programs, the expectation is that
  students would first complete their first two years of PhD course work and
  any associated qualifying exams at UC San Diego. They can then take a leave from the
  UC San Diego program, freezing their clock here, to complete the appropriate course
  work at USD. For their MSLS degree, this will require a one-year leave,
  while for their JD degree this will require two years leave. While on leave,
  students would not be eligible for financial aid from UC San Diego. Students would
  then return to UC San Diego to complete their PhD, drawing on their combined training
  here and at USD in their thesis research, and getting advice on their research
  from faculty at both universities. Each program will make specific arrangements
  to grant some course credit toward their degrees for courses taken at the other
  university. The expectation is that students will pursue dual degrees serially,
  rather than concurrently, and that the UC San Diego clock will stop while students
  are enrolled at USD. Consequently, in the normal course of events the UC San Diego
  Department of Philosophy sees no special need for extending time limits on
  advancing to candidacy, years of support, or time toward the degree. However,
  exceptional cases can be handled by petition.</p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">PhD Time Limit Policies </h3>
				<p>Students must be advanced to candidacy by the end of four years. The department’s
				  normative time to graduation is six years. Total university support cannot
			    exceed seven years. Total registered time at UC San Diego cannot exceed eight years.</p>
