				<p>As an academic field, the study of religion focuses on a set of problems, questions, and frames for intellectual attention about how human beings inhabit their social and cultural worlds in relation to what they conceive as more-than-human powers. World religions, such as Buddhism, Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and Hinduism, provide a rich set of data through which to explore such issues. But religion is bigger than that, for as an emergent phenomenon, religion appertains to the fullness of the human world. Religion emerges from literature, history, social organization, imagination, emotions, culture, and even the physical body itself.</p>
				<p>For this reason, the hallmark of UC San Diego’s Program for the Study of Religion is its interdisciplinary and interdepartmental structure. There is no discipline in the humanities or social sciences that does not provide its own rigorous and edifying window onto the phenomena of religion. Faculty from anthropology, communication, ethnic studies, history, Jewish studies, literature, philosophy, political science, sociology, and visual arts provide students with the opportunity to examine religious artifacts, practices, performances, texts, institutions, and communities within a particular cultural and historical context and in the context of comparable manifestations within the general history of religions.</p>
				<p>Because academic approaches to religion are so diverse, the program is committed to giving its students the widest practicable latitude to develop their own program of learning within the field. A concentration in the Study of Religion aims at helping students to gather the information, the analytic tools, as well as the critical acumen needed to think clearly and deeply about the place of religion in their own lives and the lives of their fellow human beings. Additionally, the program seeks to develop students&rsquo; appreciation of the difficulties and possibilities inherent in undertaking a critical, disciplined, cross-cultural study of religion; this includes making sure that students recognize the difference between confessional and scholarly discourses on religion. The program judges its success by whether its students gain a contextual understanding of the religious phenomena they investigate, and whether they are able to usefully interrogate their source materials in order to develop analytical skills in the practice of interpretation, oral discussion, and writing.</p>
<p>Since the program endorses an interdisciplinary and comparative approach to the study of religion, lower-division preparation should be wide and varied. Lower-division courses in which religion figures prominently (e.g., Introduction to Religion, Comparative World Religions, The Making of the Modern World, or the Revelle College Humanities Program),  as well as courses that focus on textual and contextual analysis and employ the analytical tools and conceptual categories of the human sciences, would all be useful in preparing the student for a major in the Study of Religion. The program strongly encourages foreign language study. The ability to read the languages of original sources and of modern scholarship is highly recommended, especially for students planning to attend graduate school in religion.</p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-1">Major </h3>
				<p>The major in the Study of Religion consists of twelve upper-division courses,
				  achieving a balance between courses that focus on a single religious tradition
				  or issue and those that explore various traditions and methodologies.
				  Requirements for the major are as follows: </p>
				<ol>
				  <li>
				    <p><strong>RELI 101 Requirement<br>
				    </strong>All majors must take RELI 101: Tools and Methods in the Study of Religion</p>
				  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><strong>Seminar Requirement</strong><br>
                      One course must be a seminar, normally RELI 189. To use a different seminar, you must petition the program&rsquo;s director. You may use your seminar to satisfy a distribution requirement and/or the tradition requirement.<br>
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><strong>Distribution Requirement<br>
                    </strong>Four courses must satisfy distribution requirements. All majors must take at least two upper-division courses within the Division of Arts and Humanities, as well as two upper-division courses within the Division of Social Sciences. Courses are to be selected from the approved course list in consultation with your faculty adviser. Neither RELI 101 nor lower-division courses can be used to satisfy this requirement. <br>
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><strong>Electives <br>
                    </strong>Six elective courses from the approved course list to be selected in consultation with your faculty adviser. You may include two lower-division courses among your electives. However, only lower-division courses with the RELI rubric are permitted. There are no exceptions to this rule. Students should see the program coordinator for further details. Please note that you must complete a total of twelve upper-division courses for the major. If you elect to apply lower-division RELI courses to the electives requirement, you will need to take additional upper-division electives to satisfy the twelve upper-division course requirement.</p>
                  </li>
				
                  <li>
                    <p><strong>Tradition Requirement<br>
                    </strong>At least two of your twelve courses must focus on the same religious tradition. Courses that satisfy this requirement take a single religious tradition as their primary object of investigation and are marked as such on the approved course list.</p>
                  </li>
                </ol>
               
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Double Major </h4>
				<p>Students may choose to pursue the Study of Religion as their second major. In such cases, it may be possible for up to two courses to overlap with the other major. Students should consult the program coordinator for further information. </p>
				<h5 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Honors in the Study of Religion </h5>
				<p>The program for the Study of Religion offers an Honors Program for students who demonstrate excellence in the major. The minimum eligibility requirements for the Honors Program are stated below. In most cases students are completing their last two quarters (winter and spring) when they enroll in the Honors Program.</p>
				<h6 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Minimum Eligibility Requirements </h6>
				<ul>
			      <li>GPA of      3.3 overall and a 3.5 in the major to enter or remain in the Honors      Program                </li>
				
                  <li class="list-level-1">RELI 101 completed prior to, or concurrently with, the honors project</li>
                  <li class="list-level-1">Junior or senior standing (completion of at least ninety units)</li>
                  <li class="list-level-1">Eight units of RELI 196AH-BH taken over two quarters (typically winter and spring)</li>
                  <li class="list-level-1">Research paper (at least twenty pages; most students write between thirty and fifty pages)</li>
                </ul>
				<p>Students interested in the Honors Program should consult with the program coordinator for a detailed list of requirements and an application. Participation in the Honors Program is contingent upon the prior approval of the honors thesis research topic by the director. Honors proposals are due at the program office by the tenth week of the quarter (usually fall quarter of the senior year) prior to being enrolled. Final approval must take place before the first day of the quarter in which the student plans to enroll in RELI 196AH-BH.				</p>
				<p>The honors student&#8217;s faculty director must certify by the end of the first term that the student is making timely progress toward the completion of his or her project. </p>
				<p>The notations Distinction, High Distinction, and Highest Distinction will be determined on the following basis: major GPA, the grade for the research paper, and the grade for the public presentation. </p>
        <h3 class="program-overview-subhead-1">Minor </h3>
				<p>The minor in the Study of Religion consists of seven courses, of which five must be upper division. Requirements for the minor are as follows: </p>
				<ol>
				  <li>
				    <p><strong>RELI 101 Requirement<br>
				    </strong>All minors must take RELI 101: Tools and Methods in the Study of Religion.<br>
				    <strong></strong></p>
				  </li>

				    </strong>Four elective courses from the approved course list to be selected in consultation with your faculty adviser. Two upper-division electives may overlap between your major and minor. You may include two lower-division courses among your electives. In addition to lower-division RELI courses, some students may apply two lower-division college requirements to the minor (e.g., Revelle students may apply HUM 1 and HUM 2, and ERC students may apply MMW 11 and MMW 12). Students should see the program coordinator for further details.</p>
				  </li>
	   
                  <li>
                    <p><strong>Tradition Requirement<br>
                    </strong>At least one of your seven courses must focus on a single religious tradition. Courses that satisfy this requirement take a single religious tradition as their primary object of investigation and are marked as such on the approved course list.</p>
