				<p>Scripps Institution of Oceanography is one of the oldest, largest, and most important centers for marine science research, education, and public service in the world. Its preeminence in the marine sciences is reflective of its excellent programs, distinguished faculty and research scientists, and outstanding facilities. Scripps Institution was founded in 1903 as an independent biological research laboratory, which became an integral part of the University of California in 1912. At that time, the laboratory was given the Scripps name in recognition of donors Ellen Browning Scripps and E. W. Scripps. Today, research and education at Scripps encompasses physical, chemical, biological, geological, and geophysical studies of the ocean, earth, and atmosphere, and Scripps is at the forefront of modern climate change science and education. Among the hundreds of research programs that may be under way at any one time are studies of air-sea interaction, climate prediction, earthquakes, the physiology of marine organisms, the geological history of the ocean basins, and multidisciplinary aspects of global change and the environment. </p>
<p class="anchor-parent"><a class="anchor" id="ugrad"></a></p><h2 class="program-overview-subhead-1">The Undergraduate Program</h2>
				<p>The Scripps Institution of Oceanography Department offers over seventy-five undergraduate courses covering a wide breadth of earth and marine sciences on several different levels. There are several introductory classes for nonmajors, and upper-division courses intended for a wide range of students in natural science majors. Scripps Institution of Oceanography offers a BS in marine biology, a BS in earth sciences, a BS in oceanic and atmospheric sciences, minors in earth sciences and marine science, and contiguous BS/MS programs in earth sciences and marine biology. Scripps Institution of Oceanography is also the academic home for the interdisciplinary environmental systems major and the climate change studies minor. See the Environmental Systems Program and the Climate Change Studies Program listings in this catalog for more information on those majors.  </p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Marine Biology Major</h3>
        <p><strong>Program Director</strong>: Ryan Hechinger, <em>Professor, Marine Biology, Scripps Institution of Oceanography</em></p>
<p>The Scripps Institution of Oceanography offers an undergraduate major program in marine biology, resulting in a BS. Undergraduates in this major will develop an understanding of the biology of marine organisms and the biological and physical processes that affect these organisms, their populations, and their coastal and oceanic ecosystems. The major requires a foundation in the natural sciences, a rigorous core of marine biology courses and a unifying laboratory/field course that engages students more directly in the discovery process and in analyzing and interpreting data. Majors select electives from a growing set of upper-division Scripps Oceanography courses in marine biology and related disciplines. The marine biology curriculum takes advantage of the UC San Diego’s unique physical location along the Pacific Ocean. Laboratory work and field trips to intertidal zones, salt marshes, and other marine ecosystems are important components of the instructional program.  </p>
        <p>Ocean sciences are relevant to many contemporary environmental issues and problems and central to understanding earth-system evolution, dynamics, climate and sustainability. A major in marine biology is an appropriate start for students who are seeking a career or graduate studies in marine biology and related biological disciplines, a career in fields such as marine conservation, or simply interested in the major to broaden their base of knowledge and experience in the biological sciences. Program advisers and faculty can provide additional information on career and graduate school opportunities. It is strongly recommended that all marine biology majors meet regularly with academic advising staff in the Scripps Institution of Oceanography Undergraduate Education Office in Galbraith Hall and with the marine biology faculty adviser to discuss and update curriculum choices. </p>
        <p>Students must receive a grade of C– or higher in any course to be counted toward fulfillment of the major requirements (with the exception of SIO 90 and SIO 139, which are only offered on a P/NP basis). One quarter of SIO 199 credit (four units) may be used as a restricted elective but does not satisfy a laboratory course requirement.</p>

			<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences Major</h3>
        
        <p><strong>Program Director</strong>: Falk Feddersen,  <em>Professor, Physical Oceanography, Scripps Institution of Oceanography</em></p>
        <p>Undergraduates in the oceanic and atmospheric sciences major will develop an understanding of the fundamental physics and chemistry governing the ocean and atmosphere. The major engages students in a wide range of topics of scientific interest and increasing social concern including ocean waves, tides and circulation, natural climate variability including El Niño, human-caused climate change, global warming, ocean acidification, atmospheric storms, and oceanic eddies. Students will acquire the tools to address these topics through basic knowledge of the fluid dynamics and chemical principles relevant to the ocean and atmosphere. Drawing on the expertise at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, the curriculum includes modern approaches to data collection in the ocean and atmosphere and the analysis of the resulting big data sets. </p>
        <p>The oceanic and atmospheric sciences curriculum takes advantage of the unique opportunities at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Classes beyond the introductory level are usually small, permitting personalized instruction, yet with access to the resources of a large research university. There are abundant&nbsp;opportunities for undergraduates to work alongside faculty, staff, and graduate students on research applications, both observational and theoretical. The major is interdisciplinary by nature and has close connections to courses and research applications in physics, chemistry, engineering, earth sciences, and environmental systems. </p>
        <p>A degree in oceanic and atmospheric sciences is an appropriate start for a broad range of career and graduate school opportunities in various areas, including research, government, state and federal survey jobs, environmental management and consulting, ocean sciences, industrial institutions, elementary or secondary education, environmental policy, or environmental law. Program advisers and faculty can provide additional information on career and graduate school opportunities. This flexibility in the major is afforded by a wide array of restricted electives that allow students a degree of autonomy to design much of their program. Career-track examples with restricted electives and faculty advising are provided to assist students in their optimal career-development track within the flexible curriculum.</p>
        <p>The oceanic and atmospheric sciences curriculum is rigorous and quantitative. Lower-division requirements are designed to provide the foundations in mathematics, physics, and chemistry that are essential in modern quantitative applications in the field. These lower-division courses are the only prerequisites for the SIO courses central to the major (Groups A and B, below). Other upper-division electives (Group C) may have additional prerequisites. In planning their major, students should check catalog course descriptions carefully and should meet with advising staff. <strong>It is strongly recommended that all oceanic and atmospheric science majors meet regularly with the academic advising staff in the SIO undergraduate education office in Galbraith Hall and faculty advisers in the major to discuss and update curriculum choices. </strong></p>
        <p>Students must receive a grade of C– or better in any course to be counted toward fulfillment of the major requirements. In exceptional cases, students with a grade point average in the major of 2.5 or greater may petition to have one grade of D accepted. All courses (lower and upper division) required for the major must be taken for a letter grade. Additionally, one quarter of SIO 199 credit (four units, P/NP) may be used as a Group C elective.

        <h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Earth Sciences Major</h3>
				<p><strong>Program Director</strong>: Jeff Gee, <em>Professor, Marine Geology, Scripps Institution of Oceanography</em></p>
                <p>The earth sciences encompass broad scientific study of the origin and evolution of the Earth and its life forms. The earth sciences major embraces a wide range of topics, including the physical and chemical evolution of our planet, the evolution of life, the causes of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, near-surface processes, the origin and behavior of the oceans and atmosphere, and the impact of humans on the environment. Earth science investigations are increasingly quantitative and experimental, and thus most upper-division courses require a strong foundation in chemistry, physics, and mathematics. </p>
				<p>The earth sciences curriculum takes advantage of the unique opportunities offered by Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Classes beyond the introductory level are usually small, permitting personalized instruction. Field trips are an important part of the instructional program. Earth sciences students are encouraged to consult with their instructors about incorporating appropriate courses and research opportunities at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography into their undergraduate curriculum. </p>
<p>A degree in earth sciences is an appropriate start for a broad range of career and graduate school opportunities in various areas, including research, government, state and federal survey jobs, environmental management, the petroleum and mining industries, consulting, ocean sciences, industrial institutions, elementary or secondary education, environmental policy, or environmental law. Program advisers and faculty can provide additional information on career and graduate school opportunities. This flexibility in the major is afforded by a wide array of restricted electives that allow students a degree of autonomy to design much of their program. Career-track examples with restricted electives and faculty advising are provided to assist students in their optimal career-development track within the flexible curriculum.</p>
<p>Lower-division requirements are designed to provide the foundations in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology that are essential in modern quantitative earth science disciplines. Students should note that several of the upper-division electives for the major have lower-division prerequisites in addition to the required prerequisites for the major. In planning their major, students should check catalog course descriptions carefully and should meet with advising staff. All earth sciences majors take an introductory course, SIO 50, and four upper-division courses introducing basic concepts in the earth sciences, SIO 100, SIO 102, SIO 103, and SIO 104. Ideally SIO 50, SIO 100 and SIO 102 should be taken before the junior year to provide the appropriate background for other upper-division courses. </p>
<p><strong>It is strongly recommended that all earth science majors meet regularly with the earth sciences academic advising staff in the Scripps Institution of Oceanography Undergraduate Education Office in Galbraith Hall and a faculty adviser, from those listed in career tracks below, to discuss and update curriculum choices. </strong></p>
<p>A grade point average of 2.0 or higher in the upper-division major program is required for graduation. Students must receive a grade of C– or better in any course to be counted toward fulfillment of the major requirements. In exceptional cases, students with a grade point average in the major of 2.5 or greater may petition to have one grade of D accepted. All courses (lower and upper division) required for the major must be taken for a letter grade. </p>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Special Studies Courses</h4>
				<p>Special studies in the earth sciences are offered as the courses SIO 198 and SIO 199. These courses are subject to consent of the instructor and approval by the earth sciences faculty adviser. They are open to students who have accrued at least ninety quarter-units and have a GPA of at least 3.0. One quarter of SIO 199 studies may be counted toward the earth sciences major. </p>

        <p>An earth sciences major is good preparation for students who are considering K-12 science education and/or public education and outreach as a career. Students with these interests should consider the academic minor in science education, offered through the Education Studies Program, as a complement to the earth sciences major. </p>
        <p>Recommended elective:</p>
        <p class="course-list-overview">SIO 180. Communicating Science to Informal Audiences</p>
        <h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Honors Program</h3>
				<p>The Honors Program at Scripps Institution of Oceanography is offered for a limited number of students who have demonstrated excellence in the earth sciences major or the marine biology major. Students are eligible for admission to the program when they have </p>
<ol>
  <li>Completed      ninety units of courses including twelve units of upper-division      course work in their major (earth sciences or marine biology). </li>
  <li>Achieved      a GPA of 3.3 overall and 3.5 in the major. </li>
  <li>Submitted      to the Undergraduate Education Steering Committee, and had approved, an      honors thesis research proposal. </li>
</ol>

<p>Successful completion of the Honors Program requires</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Maintenance of a GPA of 3.3 overall and 3.5 in the major. </li>
				  <li>Completion, with a B grade or higher, of a minimum of eight units
				    of SIO 196 related to the honors thesis research, distributed
				    over at least two quarters. These units must be in addition
				    to the ordinary major requirements. However, students who subsequently
				    fail to complete the Honors Program may apply up to four of these 196
				    units to their major. </li>
				  <li>Acceptance of a written honors thesis report by a committee of not
				    fewer than three faculty members. </li>
				  <li>Satisfactory presentation of an oral report on the thesis research,
				    preferably at a public undergraduate research conference
				    on campus, or at a professional conference. Alternatively,
				    the oral report may be given at a seminar involving honors students and
				    at least three faculty members. </li>
	    </ol>
		<p>Students who successfully complete the Honors Program will graduate With High Distinction. </p>
				<p>Students who are interested in the Honors Program should contact the program
				  adviser in Galbraith Hall, Room 368, Revelle College.</p>
				<p>(See <a href="SIO-gr.html">Scripps Institution of Oceanography graduate
				    program</a> for information
			    on the “<a href="SIO-gr.html#contig">Contiguous Bachelor’s/Master’s Earth Sciences
			    Degree Program</a>.”)</p>
<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Earth Sciences Minor</h3>
				<p>A minor in earth sciences consists of twenty-eight units of earth sciences courses, at least twenty of which must be upper-division from Groups A, B and C above. Courses required by a student’s major may not be applied toward a minor and neither can SIO 198 nor SIO 199. Students interested in the earth sciences minor should meet with the earth sciences academic advising staff to discuss their curriculum choices.</p>

<h3 class="program-overview-subhead-2">Marine Science Minor</h3>
				<p>The Scripps Institution of Oceanography offers an undergraduate minor program in marine science. The minor curriculum is designed to complement the strong disciplinary training of UC San Diego basic science majors by providing a broad interdisciplinary perspective with an environmental focus. Ocean-related science is relevant to many contemporary environmental issues and problems and central to understanding Earth-system evolution, dynamics, climate, and sustainability. The minor consists of courses and research opportunities offered primarily through faculty and researchers at Scripps. The mix of these components can be tailored to reflect students&#8217; career interests through an “all courses” track or a “research” track. The “all courses” track offers a very flexible curriculum that serves students with a broad range of educational and career interests including environmental management and regulation, teaching, environmental law, economics and policy and a wide variety of graduate programs. The “research” track is designed for students interested in an undergraduate research experience at Scripps and serves as excellent preparation for graduate research studies.</p>
				<p>The minor consists of twenty-eight units of course work, at least twenty
				  of which must be upper division. Courses required by a student&#8217;s
				  major may not be applied toward the minor. Up to two courses for the minor
				  may be taken on a Pass/Not Pass basis (upper or lower division). Students
				  must earn at least a letter grade of C– in the remaining five or more courses
				  used for the minor. The marine science minor places a strong emphasis on
				  a rigorous natural science foundation; thus, several of the upper-division
				  courses related to the minor have significant prerequisites. Students planning
				  the minor should check catalog course descriptions carefully and should
				  meet with advising staff in the Scripps Institution of Oceanography Office
				  of Undergraduate Programs, Galbraith Hall, Room 188. </p>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Lower-Division Requirements </h4>
				<ol>
				  <li>SIO 30. The Oceans</li>
				  <li>Any one of the following lower-division courses may be applied to
				    the minor requirements<br />
				    SIO 10. The Earth<br />
SIO 12. History of the Earth and Evolution<br />
SIO 20. The Atmosphere<br />
SIO 35. Water<br />
SIO 40. Life and Climate on Earth <br />
SIO 50. Introduction to Earth and Environmental
Sciences</li>
	    </ol>
				<p>Additionally, any math, chemistry, physics, or biology course that is
				  a prerequisite for an upper-division elective for the marine
				  science minor (e.g., MATH 20 series; CHEM 6A, 6B, 6C; PHYS 2 series; BILD 1, 2, 3) may be applied, by petition, as a lower-division
	    requirement for the minor&#8217;s major. </p>
				<h4 class="program-overview-subhead-3">Upper-Division Requirements </h4>
				<h5 class="program-overview-subhead-4">Option 1—All Courses Track</h5>
